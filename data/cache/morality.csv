R:I guess my religious beliefs.

R:Um.

R:Just a feeling I get and influence and just talking to um, people who have been there and stuff like that.
I:Okay, ah any specific examples come up from your life about when you confronted a situation and you really knew something was maybe very right or very wrong to do and you had that feeling that you were talking about?

I:Has it gotten easier or harder to decide between right and wrong over the past few years?

I:How so?  Can you tell me an example?
R:Well I think probably because my priorities in high school and stuff like that weren’t the same as they are now like I guess I found the more important things in life and focused on those even if it is like religion and family and things like that.
I:So your views have changed in the past couple of years about what’s right and wrong?
R:No.  I think they are just maybe become more solidified and a little less gray area.
I:So what kind of gray areas like?
R:Maybe the type of music I listen to, the things that I watch, even just like tinny little things morally.
I:Like what?
R:I don’t know… how intense your kissing gets or that kind of thing.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Maybe is it going to make you happy in the long run not necessarily momentary pleasure and commitments with God, whether your…it wouldn’t harm somebody else or make them happier.

I was gonna ask next, then, where do your own beliefs about right and wrong come from?  You’ve already spoken to that, it sounds like.
R:Yeah, yeah.
I:So religion you would say?
R:Christian, yeah.
I:Christian religion, okay.
R:And just common sense, most of the time.
I:Okay, okay.  Um, so the, then the thing says, can you give me some specific examples of what would be kind of right and wrong, like from a Christian viewpoint, do you think?  In other words, something that shows like what makes something right or wrong for you, given your beliefs?
R:Well I think most of it would be common sense and knowledge about it, so what would be right or wrong, like, like some things like sharing it’s just, it’s just right and then there’s keeping everything to yourself or stealing, which is wrong.  Stealing is just wrong, it’s just common sense.
I:Okay.  Um, so do you, so when you decide how something is good or bad or right or wrong, you, you apply common sense it sounds like?
R:Yes, and religion, as well.
I:Okay and religion.
R:What I’ve learned mostly.","I disagree with that, being brought up in a Christian household and having a firm belief in God and, and um, what is right and wrong, so I disagree with that. Yeah, yeah. Christian, yeah. And just common sense, most of the time. Well I think most of it would be common sense and knowledge about it, so what would be right or wrong, like, like some things like sharing it’s just, it’s just right and then there’s keeping everything to yourself or stealing, which is wrong.  Stealing is just wrong, it’s just common sense. Yes, and religion, as well. What I’ve learned mostly.","The respondent, raised in a Christian household, relies on religious beliefs and common sense to determine right from wrong, acknowledges occasional mistakes, and feels no peer pressure regarding substance use, while also recognizing the importance of parental discipline and guidance in their life decisions.","I:All right.  Um, so, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, and right and wrong in life?
R:Most the time, I would use my religion to determine what’s right and wrong, however, in certain situations, I have my own beliefs concerning it, you know, that I may not find the direct answer and specific answer to in the scriptures, then I, I look at life experience and determine what’s right on my own.  My parents have always told me that I’ve had this innate sense of right and wrong, so I think I’m doing something—
I:Yeah, you said innate sense of right and wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  All right, is it generally pretty easy or kind of hard for you to decide in those situations?
R:Generally, it’s not so black and white, like with some of the more controversial issues going around that I mentioned before, that’s why I’ve talked to so many people about it, you know, I’m trying to find it, figure out what’s right and wrong and I see what other people have beliefs of, regarding, so it’s probably not so easy for me.  You know I have a lot to live, I’ve only seen a little bit of this world and so far, most of it has been contained in West Bend* for about 10 years.
I:Contained in West Bend*, yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.
R:Yeah, so, haven’t experienced a lot yet.  So I’m still probably gonna change some of my beliefs or opinions depending on the situation or what more I experience.
I:Okay, okay.  Do you think that deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder in these past two years?
R:Probably harder in the past two years, but that just comes along with being a teenager.  Because you’re starting to experience more life around you and you’re meeting all these new people that have different opinions than you, and so you have a lot more to take into consideration and you know, you feel lost in who you are, and stuff like that.
I:Okay.  So, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:That’s a tough question.  Well one of the easiest, but this doesn’t encompass them all, easiest place to determine if something is right or wrong, is if it hurts another person or it hurts yourself.  Another way to determine it would be, you know, ah, take the Bible into consideration, you know, what it says would be right or wrong.  Not so significant, is what other people think, you know.  You can always, just can, you can consolidate  on anybody on what they believe is right or wrong.  So that’s pretty much it, the church and other influences.
I:Okay.  So, so you said, one of those, one of the keys is to think about if it hurts you or hurts anybody else, and another key is looking at the Bible, what the Bible says, less important is, you know what other people might think.  How would you weigh or consider those first two parts of the, what’s right and wrong, together?
R:This gets complicated.  Because this is a question of underlying faith and the foundation of the church, you know, disagreeing with the church on some issues or not.  I guess it really depends on your interpretation of the Bible.  So that the Bible would be the most important.  But, ah, and then comes the, talking to other people.  So I would say, yeah, the Bible is probably more important.  Not necessarily the church.
I:Okay, okay.  Um, all right.  And so, when you say that the Bible is really important, um, what are you, when you look at something in the Bible, do you feel like, um, the guidance in there is literal or bad  there’s some cultural differences or how, how do you go in to interpreting the right and wrong decisions through the Bible, yourself?
R:Well there are a lot of little nuances in the scripture, but I do think there are cultural differences, and I do think that some things are meant literally and then some are meant figuratively, that are not to be taken literally.  I guess, but it really depends on your individual interpretation of the scripture and how it affects your life and that’s probably the best way to interpret it.
I:Okay.  Are there some interpretations that are better or worse?
R:This is also complicated.  Because I believe that some interpretations would be good for other people and not necessarily myself.  Um, an example would be, you know who, people who read the scripture and _______
I:I’m just ah, I’m trying to get a sense of how you would use the Bible to interpret what’s right and wrong?
R:Okay, like I said, I would read it, I would look for the little, the nuances in scripture.  I would look, what would make the most sense, probably, between the literal and the figurative, the figurative translations and interpretations.
I:Okay.  Are there any, any things that are always in themselves wrong, or not?
R:If by ___________   I just lost my train of thought again.
I:Oh, that’s okay, that’s okay.  I was just, I was trying to get at if there were some things that are in and of themselves wrong.
R:I would say yes.
I:You would say yes, okay.
R:There are some things that are just wrong, and they should probably be pretty easy to tell, whether they’re wrong or not.
I:Okay.   And, ah, I mean, what would--could you give me some examples, maybe?
R:Well, nothing good comes from jealousy and nothing good comes of greed, hate.  So those things are wrong because you know, they drive, drive the person to do things you normally wouldn’t.
I:Okay, all right.  From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Well, like I said, mostly from scripture and most of it is from church, but being a teenager now myself and being a little more intellectual than I was as a child, you know, I’ve started to critique and look at my own beliefs and the only reason I’ve kept them is because I still believe them.  You don’t even have to look _____________  and double check it.
I:Okay.  Do you feel like you’ve been looking into these views and ideas more in these past two years than you had before?
R:Yes.
I:Yes, a lot more?  I mean, has it really changed for you, is that something you did two years or more ago, as well?
R:Well, like I said, I just started talking a lot more to people about them and learning as much as I can.","Most the time, I would use my religion to determine what’s right and wrong, however, in certain situations, I have my own beliefs concerning it, you know, that I may not find the direct answer and specific answer to in the scriptures, then I, I look at life experience and determine what’s right on my own.

So how do you decide or know what is good or bad or right and wrong in life?
R:Just, like, well my parents have taught me a lot.  And then, in school we had to take, like, leaderships classes and they taught us a lot about morals and stuff.  So, just like, deciding whether it’s an ethical dilemma or a moral decision and, I think that, really, gives you a lot of good ways to figure out what you are feeling and how you think you should approach situations.
I:What kind of principals did you feel you learned there?
R:A lot about honor and just keeping your honor.  And, um, that was kind of our biggest thing, I guess.
I:In general, do you feel like it is easy or hard to make those decisions about what is right and wrong?
R:I think it’s pretty easy I guess, as long as you, but I think it’s more like how you feel about yourself and then how feel your decision will make a difference.
I:OK.  Do you think deciding between right and wrong have gotten easier or harder over the past couple of years?
R:I think kind of both.  Like, I think it’s harder because you are set up with more situations and you have to make them.  And I think it’s easier because you are more aware of right and wrong.
I:Ok.  So how, specifically, (interrupted by waitress)  Um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Probably consequences.  What it can do to effect you and what it can do to effect other people.
I:Um, so what kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:I guess if it would hurt someone else, or, going to potentially hurt you.
I:Ok.  Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves?
R:I don’t know.    I guess, like, illegal things are actions that are wrong.  I guess something said to be illegal it’s not my kind of values.
I:Is there any situation when something illegal, can you just do something illegal to help someone, or?  Or, do you then have to rethink it, or is it always whatever is illegal is wrong?
R:It’s hard to say like, what if.  Because everything can change.  But, I think it does at certain times though, you go thru certain, like, tests, to figure out…I don’t know, we always talked about like tests to figure out what happened, which was you should go, and it’s, like, I think you can figure out yourself whether it’s right or wrong.  So, even if it’s, like, potentially could be wrong, you yourself might need to do it for your conscience and stuff.
I:Uh hum.
R:And sometimes bad consequences can be under weighed by good consequences.","Just, like, well my parents have taught me a lot.

And how do you normally decide what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I think I base a lot off instincts.  I think that I was brought up with a good idea of what was right and wrong, and if it was okay, which goes with my head and heart telling me.
I:So, in general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I don’t think it’s very hard.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder in the over the last few years?
R:I don’t think it’s really changed, so that took away from the good concept.
I:So, in general, how do you decide what’s right or wrong?  What’s the instinct based on?
R:It would be based on really just the kind of values that I’ve grown up with and the people I think I would refer people around me a lot to people with guidance, or to look at what they’re doing in similar situations.
I:What kinds of people do you turn to for guidance?
R:Normally I go to my friends, or my mom, or my brother.
I:And has there ever been a situation that you’ve needed to get their advice on, or get their guidance?
R:The last thing I went to get advice was I had to figure out what internship to take.  That’s not really a right or wrong.
I:Okay.  And, what would you say basically makes something right or wrong?  Is it a consequence, a feeling?
R:I think you’re happy what you get right.  I would go with a feeling or not.  You feel okay with it after it’s said and done, then it’s an okay decision.
I:Okay.  So, is there anything in the situation that before it’s over that tells you?
R:I don’t know.
I:No?  Okay.  How about, well if you were really stuck on trying to make a decision, what would be the deciding factor for you, like how it affects you, how it affects, maybe rules or laws, or consequences?
R:I don’t know.  I’m not very good at this like crises, like I would call the problem.  It just depends on circumstance, if it only affected then I’m in it, like how it affects me, it affects other people, lay out pros and cons and how does it affect me or other people, and then decide.  I would, I don’t know.
I:And from where do you think that you’ve acquired your views on morality?
R:From my friends and my family.
I:So, how does, cuz you mentioned that your mom is religious, and you know, goes to church and all that, so is that, have you acquired your views from there?  You mentioned that you thought you were maybe more like your dad in that respect.
R:I don’t know.  I think that, I don’t know.  I really don’t think that there is a legitimate claim to much into like, strict morality.  I don’t think that her being more religious has made her more moral, so I don’t think that’s really changed any of my values that I’ve taken from her.","I think I base a lot off instincts.

R:Typically, I try to base it off of what would my dad think.  You just know if something is wrong.  I don’t know.  It’s just what my parents instilled in me, like, how you raise your kids is how they’re gonna be or whatever.
I:So you said you normally would, I mean, it’s your parents influence would be the main thing that you strive for, and for them, how did they figure out what’s right and wrong, like, what was their basis for them?

I:Okay.  And for you, is it generally easy or hard to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s not too hard at all.
I:Okay.  And has it become easier or harder over the last few years?
R:Not at all.
I:Like, is it the same or is it getting easier or getting harder?
R:Maybe it seems a little harder because I’m 20 or whatever, but I still can’t drink – that’s kind of weird, but –
I:Okay.  Right.  Do you think that will be a concern once you can drink –
R:No.
I:– whether you’re worried about it?
R:No.  I wouldn’t see myself in the bar.  I don’t have an addictive personality.  I can’t see myself hammered on a barstool, “Hey,”  or whatever.
I:Yeah.  Do think your right and wrong has changed in any way in the last few years?
R:Not really.  No.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think there would be personal views or value is.  How you feel on a situation.
I:Is it your feelings mainly or is it the results of the action or –
R:I think it is personal views, mainly in results of actions too because – I don’t know – those crazy serial killers that think what they’re doing is right, but obviously it’s not –
I:So how do you – what basis do you determine that?
R:I guess you have to go by if anybody is being physically abused or hurt or something is being taken away from them.  I guess that’s what’s wrong.
I:That’s absolutely wrong at all times?
R:I don’t know.  That’s a difficult question.
I:Okay.  Okay.  So you’re not sure what would be the basis for –
R:Well, I know personally with me, if my personal views, like, I’m not gonna want to kill someone, that’s wrong on –
I:But is it wrong for you or is just plain wrong and no one should do it even if someone thinks it’s right, it’s – they’re, you know, they’re mistaken?
R:I think it’s just plain wrong because, I mean, even if someone is on death row or something, I don’t think we have the right to kill them.
I:Okay.
R:I mean, I don’t know.
I:But why – do you have any reason for why that’s wrong or –
R:It kind of puts us in the same – it doesn’t make us any better than them.
I:Okay.
R:And they say that God’s the only one who can really just judge you or justify what goes on, but yeah, I just think we don’t have the right to take someone’s life –
I:Okay.
R:– especially even if they killed someone.  I mean, that doesn’t make us any better than them.  It kind of lowers us down to their standards.
I:Would you say it’s God’s – the final – has the final word on what’s right and wrong or do you think it’s simply your culture or –
R:For me, I think God does, but obviously other cultures believe in other things.
I:Right, but you can disagree with them and think they’re mistaken if some cultures want to kill people or –
R:Yeah.  I would just think that – I guess with ethics they would think that that would be wrong, but I guess you can’t really judge them.  I don’t know.  That’s just like cannibalism.  I don’t know why somebody would want to do that or anything, but I don’t know.   or whatever, that’s what they believed in, but I guess it would be an honored sacrifice back then, but I don’t know.
I:Would you say that that’s wrong or would you say that –
R:Now, if that was to happen in today’s standards I guess you could, but I don’t know, it’s difficult.
I:Where do you think you’ve acquired your moral views from?  Is it mainly your parents or are there other things that influenced how you think about this?

R:Ah, when it comes to drugs I think they knew that I could make the decisions for myself, I’m a smart kid.

R:Ah, I don’t know, there’s just a basic nature to everything and there’s a, um,  right and wrong um, oh man, how do I put this? Ah,  just, at the very like core of everything, I mean, everything, like once when I was bad like when it’s not a, as a serious, as serious of a thing as like  ah, it’s just different, I think, man it’s, it’s kind of a weird thing, it’s, I think it’s just different degrees of seriousness, um, determine right and wrong.  If that makes sense, I don’t know.
I:Okay, can you give me an example of like things, things with different degrees of seriousness?
R:Um, like,  like if you like raped a girl or if you like I don’t know, took like a candy bar or something from the store or something.  If you rape a girl, it’s like  there, there’s nothing good about that, there’s, the girl doesn’t come out very well and the, the guy is, obviously out there, but I mean, if you like took a candy bar or something because you were like, really hungry or something, as opposed to like just taking it, just to take it, that’s wrong, but like if you’re like hungry, that wouldn’t, I don’t think a wrong thing.  But it, it depends on who you are, too, just how you think.
I:Like what, what, do you mean it depends on who you are, what does that mean?
R:Um, how you were brought up and stuff like that.  What, what your parents taught you was right and wrong, what your different experiences throughout your life were.
I:Okay, um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?

This isn’t wrong what I’m doing.  I can do this.  But with some people they think man, I can’t believe you could do this, you know.

It’s a perception I’ve built up through, through my life, so.  It’s just, something, it’s more, just something you have to develop for yourself.

I:Do you think that’s okay, or does that bother you?
R:I don’t know, I think it bothers me, like I can’t, I always have to ask somebody else what they’re going to do so I’ll know what I wanna do, it’s like, why don’t I know what I wanna do?  It’s like I have to have somebody else’s opinion before I know what I wanna do.
I:Why do you think that’s the case?
R:Do I think it’s okay?
I:Why do you think that’s the case, sorry, I got food in my mouth.

Over the past couple of years had gotten harder because like, the older you are the more findings you have to deal with, and so when you’re younger it doesn’t really just… your parents just usually take up, you know, whatever is or is not right or wrong is just usually, if I take this pen, that’s wrong, you know and that’s the only thing, when we was younger that’s what you had to deal with, now you have to deal with bigger things. My what? No, not really.  That makes something right or wrong? You just get this… you know,  like if you do something right, you’re going to get this good feeling; you know what I’m saying? About what you did, but if you’re doing something wrong, you won’t … you’re going to get a bad feeling. You’re going to go like, “this is not right” you know, and it’s going to be a conscience that’s going to eat in at you when you do something wrong. Yeah.  My parents probably. My grandma.","The respondent expresses a desire to leave their small town for a fresh start, relies on feelings and intuition to determine right from wrong, acknowledges the influence of their parents on their moral views, and believes in seeking advice from trusted adults when unsure about decisions."

I:And do you um, do you think of like what makes something right or wrong, if you had a kind of moral code, could you define that or you know, just curious about that.
R:Well, I mean, it, it kind of comes like naturally though, really.  Like I mean, like I don’t know how to explain it, it just kind of ah, like you just know somehow, like that’s not cool or you know.

I mean, in general, how do you figure that out?
R:I think about it as if someone themselves gets hurt, if one individual is hurt themselves, it’s kinda hard to think about it.
I:I mean, your own decisions every day, like when you want to figure out what’s right and wrong, how do you, what do you base that on?
R:I’ve had friends who’ve told me a lot of things about like, oh well they’ve gone into store and put things in their pockets and don’t care- and I just kind of laugh at that and go like “Hah, well I don’t care either ‘cause Target* or so and so’s a big corporation, they have money.”  Whereas if you were stealing from me or my neighbor who doesn’t have that much money, then you’re kind of hurting them more, whereas you just steal a DVD from Wal-Mart, they got 10 of the DVDs.  They’re not gonna be really hurting.  They have like a lawyers and things like that, funds that will cover them for these kind of situations.  So it’s like, yeah my friend told me “Yeah I stole a DVD” it’s like I laugh and go “I don’t care.  That’s cool.”  You know, it’s not that cool, but it’s funny ‘cause your putting something that I don’t care about, whereas people as individual, I would never want to steal, or hurt someone as an individual I feel like they’re more vulnerable as one person.  Whereas like a corporation like a gas station or something is not one person, even though in reality, in essence it is.  It’s probably like a family owned business or whatever, eventually it’ll trickle down to one person or a few CEOs or shareholders or whatever, but I think of it in terms of if it’s hurting one individual it’s wrong.  If it’s not hurting an individual, it’s not really wrong.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to figure out what’s right and wrong and has that changed over the last few year-?
R:I would say yes, it is.  And yes that has changed over the past few years.  Yes it has gotten easier to distinguish what’s right and wrong in my own mind.  But I also think that one has to acquire those thoughts throughout a series of significant experiences in life, and that right and wrong, there’s not an exact information.  If that is in one mind what is right and wrong and one should decide for themselves what is right and wrong and how to live their lives.  I feel.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right and wrong?  Like what’s, why is something right?  Why is something wrong?
R:Well I, could easily put it, something right would be, someone’s benefiting then it seems to be right.
I:So like consequences?  Good consequences for people?
R:If there’s more for the bad then obviously it’s not a good thing.  If there’s more consequences that are good and that do benefit people then yeah it’s probably a better thing and it probably leans more towards the better things of the spectrum than the, then the more than wrong you know, probably it’s more better, you know, obviously, if people are dying and getting hurt, it’s probably not a good thing, ever, in any situation.  I look at things like war as a complete waste of time and money.  Why go over to Iraq and Afghanistan and kill these innocent kids when they’re just trying to live a life like we are?  In fact, they’re more in a hardship than we are, you know, they have a harder time just ‘cause they’re economy is in more of a stronghold than we are, we’re more open and we have all this money, whereas people over there, they’re no different than I am just ‘cause their skin is a little darker doesn’t mean they think different than I do.  You know, thinking like that has basically opened my mind up to what is right and what’s wrong and how do people benefit and could they not benefit, could they suffer because of this.  So, you know, I feel like people like our President George Bush probably doesn’t think about that and maybe has a different idea of what I do of what’s right and wrong.
I:Where do you get your ideas of right and wrong from?  Like what influences your thinking?
R:Basically, I would have to say my parents and what they’ve taught me.  Some things, like speeding, things like that, I’ve kinda just formed my own brain into thinking well I’m doing it so it’s probably wrong but I don’t really care because I’m getting to work quicker and no one’s necessarily being hurt by me speeding, so is it wrong?  Well illegal, the government says it’s wrong, but in my mind I don’t believe because I’m getting to work faster.  Yes, it’s dangering, endangering the life of me and others at the same time but who’s benefiting?  I’m benefiting and who’s not benefiting, or should I say, what’s the opposite of benefit?  To lose?
I:Sure.
R:Yeah, no one’s losing by me speeding, but if I do get in an accident, that’s when someone is losing and it’ll probably be me and them.  So I don’t think of it as a right or wrong, but I think, after all those years, all the speeding without thinking about it, has just formed that thought in my mind, just naturally of growing up and thinking it might be wrong but I don’t want to put to much thought into it because I’m going to be late to work if I do.

R:How good, could you repeat the question?
I:Oh it was just asking in general how do you decide what’s good or bad or right or wrong?
R:I guess from past experiences as far as uh, places I go, uh, I mean I go to a club that’s generally a lot of fighting or run into other people, I generally not go to that one.  Uh, I make, I guess I make pretty good decisions.  Sometimes I don’t.  It depends on what the situation is, I make it for I guess.

R:I mean if it’s, is it right for me not to do it, I mean if it’s wrong, I make that decision, but it’s easy for me to make a right decision if I know that it’s right.  If I, if it’s wrong, it’d probably be easier for me not to do, I mean it just depends on what it is.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?

I:And why do you think it’s become easier to make the right decision?
R:Uh, probably my maturity, I’m mature, understanding stuff, the consequences, I would say.  Here’s the consequences and what could happen and what won’t happen.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um probably what happens, uh, hm, can you repeat the question?
I:Yeah, just what is it in your mind that makes some thing right or wrong?
R:It’s something, if I do something right and something good happens, okay then I must have made the right decision.  But if I did something bad and something bad happens, it must have made the wrong decision.  That’s how I look at it.
I:What kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:Uh, say I go somewhere I wasn’t supposed to and somebody sees me and they tell somebody like my mom and she finds out, then that’s probably bad, that’s something bad like that.  Or uh, if I study for a test and get a B or A on it, I must have done something, I must have made the right decision.
I:Are there any actions that are always right or always wrong?
R:Um, not really, well what do you mean by that?
I:Can you think of something that you know is always wrong to do.
R:Is always wrong?
I:Uh-huh
R:Probably would be drinking and driving, that’s mainly, I mean there’s nothing wrong with drinking, but driving, driving there would be something wrong with all the time.
I:And what do you think makes that wrong all the time?
R:Uh, it’s a rule I thought.  It’s a rule that you’re not supposed to drink and drive, so you’re breaking a rule.  I guess that’s wrong.  I’d say that’s wrong.

I:So it’s something you feel or just know?
R:Pretty much both. If I know something’s right, if I know drinking, you shouldn’t drink, that’s wrong.
I:How would you know that?  How do you know that?
R:Just my upbringing I guess, you know, always grew up someone told me you don’t need to smoke; smoking’s not good for you.  And growing up you see all the ads about smoking and what is does to your body, on top of the things that you already do.  So that would make it even worse.
I:And how hard or easy is it for you to know what’s wrong and right?
R:It’s pretty much easy.  I mean pretty much some of the things I do is repetitious so pretty much the same thing.  So anything out of the ordinary I can recognize I shouldn’t be doing this and search for another way
I:So you kind get in a good routine.
R:yeah.
I:And have your moral views changed at all in the last couple years?
R:No, I wouldn’t say that. Yeah.
I:What is it that makes them that way?
R:That depends on the person.  I may feel that something’s wrong or right that you may not feel that it’s wrong or right.  Inside a person, through the situation.
I:But if it really comes down to how people feel about it, then really there are really no rights or wrongs, it’s just people’s feelings.
R:Well…
I:Like for example.  If I was a twisted person and I enjoyed hurting other people, I would feel like it’s a good thing, I want to do it, there’s nothing wrong with it, but I really think- my real self is, No that would be wrong.  There would be something wrong with me.  And even if I felt it was okay, I would be wrong.  So what is it that makes something objectively right or wrong and not just how people feel about it?
R:I guess.  Um.  That’s tough.
I:Do you know what I’m saying?
R:I know what you’re saying.  But…I guess, um.  I guess.  I don’t know.
I:Okay, so you said you know partly from how you were raised.  When you were brought up, what was explained to you about here’s why things are right or wrong?
R:Okay.  Pretty much what boils down for me was not having sex until you’re married.  You’re not supposed to do it, in the Bible. That’s one of the things that was told to me, it was constantly told to me, so.
I:So something being from the Bible.  That would partly makes something right or wrong?
R:Yeah, for me it would.
I:Do you believe that? If it’s in the Bible that helps to define right or wrong?
R:Yeah.  And, that’s tough.
I:Like why is stealing wrong?
R:Because it’s not yours.
I:So what? I could make it mine.
R:Well, I mean that’s how I feel.  If it’s not mine I shouldn’t take it.
I:But is there anything other than your feelings about it that make it wrong.
R:I mean, similarly, if you steal something there’s going to be a consequence.  If you don’t want to face that consequence, you shouldn’t have stole it.  There’s always a cause and effect.  So if you do something it’s going to be a reaction to it.
I:What if a society decided, well stealing’s not really wrong so we should stop punishing each other for it.  Survival of the fittest.  Whoever gets away with the most, that’s what they get away with.
R:Then we might have a world of chaos.  A lot of chaos then.
I:Okay.
R:If people think it’s okay to steal.
I:Uh huh.  So partly you’re saying right or wrong is defined by the Bible, and partly it’s defined by potentially the law or consequences.
R:And just by, I guess the society as a whole.  Like what people view as, that’s not right.
I:Uh huh.  Society’s view.
R:Right. Sometimes how I look at it, some people twist it in a way that they, it may not be, they put it in their favor.
I:But sometimes society as a whole is totally wrong.  In this country with slavery, in the ‘30s with the Nazis.  I mean the Germans in the ‘30s just thought we just exterminate Jews.  Now we look back and say that was wrong.
R:Sooner or later, you know maybe fifty something is different.  Maybe it still won’t be okay here.
I:But do you think there are things no matter what people think about them, one way or the other it’s just right or wrong.  It’s just the way it is.  Like murder, stealing, adultery, whatever like that.
R:I mean, probably not.  I mean, I don’t know.  If you think about murder, some people maybe could have reason to murder somebody.  You know, there’s always a reason when you do something.","Pretty much my decision-making is pretty good so I just, if it feels wrong or I know it’s wrong I pretty much try to stay away from it and don’t do it.

I:M11:So is hurting other people the definition of making something morally M11:wrong?
R:M11:No.  Making something morally wrong is something that like your M11:personal convictions, um, something that well, I wouldn’t say society has M11:said is wrong, there’s a lot of stuff society says now isn’t exactly M11:considered,
I:M11:So what if it’s not against my personal convictions to,

R:M11:Something that’s between you and like I don't know your conscience. M11:Um, and your background and your belief system, your ethics, that,
I:M11:So then it might not be morally wrong for me, but it would be morally M11:wrong for you?
R:M11:Yes.  It could be that way.  Because some people have different views M11:on morality and some people have different views on ethics, some people M11:are more conservative than others, but I mean I could say I wouldn’t, I M11:mean cause actually people always go to the bible and stuff, but the bible M11:doesn’t exactly say anything about not drinking alcohol, but I don't know M11:considering that it puts so, that I see more wrong things I would say more M11:bad things end up happening out of it than good things and for me that M11:would make it more of a wrong situation than a right.
I:M11:Okay.  So what does the bible have to do with morality?
R:M11:I don't know there’s laws for morality it sets um everything in the bible M11:that sets rules for laws and stuff like that especially the ten commandments M11:and stuff like that all those rules are just a good social rule, if not, like M11:they’re used by the like adultery’s like obviously not something that’s M11:inside the constitution or that that would interpret, but I think,
I:M11:It’s not against the law.
R:M11:It’s not against the law.  But I think,
I:M11:Right, but is it morally wrong?
R:M11:I think it’s morally wrong just because it’s something there’s more M11:wrong things in it than there are good.  Um, so most of the majority of the M11:social rules are those rules if not used like in laws, like don’t kill anybody M11:and stuff are good social rules to live by and um, I mean you can’t really, M11:doing stuff like that you can live a really good upright life, um, in front of I M11:don't know whoever you’re trying to impress or whatever, but it’s just that M11:they, that all those rules are, are some, are good, I mean everybody can use M11:them even if they’re not Christian I mean, even if they’re like Jewish, M11:Moslem, whatever, um, all those rules are rules that are good um, and good M11:upright rules that society can use, um, even if they’re not laws, so,","Probably from my parents and from church and from the community also that we lived in or I grew up in.

I:I got you.  has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years or so?

I:Ok.  Why would you say that?

I:You know what… I mean I just… I mean that’s what you’ve been taught, but why not how it feels or just the consequence of it or…?
R:I think sometimes I do think about the consequences probably moreso than…
I:But that’s not your first…?
R:That’s not usually the first thing.  I think consequences are probably the second thing, if I’m really thinking it through.  at camp we used to joke, it’s better to ask for permission than forgiveness, you know, or better… it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission.

Um, that we ask all the teens we interview, sort of how people know right or wrong or whether they think there’s right or wrong or what, how that plays out in their life, ah, what is your general thinking about what makes things right or wrong or good or bad or wise or unwise, etcetera?
R:Um, I think there’s a standard and there’s morals, whether people want to believe it or not and there’s a definite right and wrong.  And whether they get that from the Bible or from their family or the law, there is moral, there is morals and there is right and wrongs that people know not to steal because it’s illegal, but because our country was based on biblical principles and keep going way back and back and back and we were all created in God’s image and so we all have a sense of like, duty, um, and obligation, because we were created in God’s image and so whether people get their morals from the law, it all goes back to what God said for us.

I:Okay, and that can be expressed in like laws?  Like governmental laws?
R:It can be.
I:Or not?
R:I think that it is.
I:If the government makes a law, does that mean that this is God’s will?
R:No, I don’t think that, just because the government makes a law, that’s God’s will.  But there are morals for people that even if they don’t believe in God or they don’t have any sort of religious faith, that there is morals and certain things that they should go by because there is law.
I:Okay.  So you’re saying, ah, correct me if I’m wrong, people that believe in God will act morally because they believe in God, but people that don’t believe in God, it’s the government’s job to get them to act morally, even though they don’t believe in God?
R:Um, no.  That if people that don’t believe in God and they’re like, oh, I don’t have anywhere to get morals from, and they’re like, oh the government has a law.
I:Do you think, what do you think about conscience, I mean, I interview people that don’t believe in God and they just say they intuitively know right and wrong, what about that?
R:Well, they intuitively know right and wrong because whether they want to believe it or not, everyone is created in God’s image and so because of that, we all have the right and wrong, and conscience, in us and, yeah.
I:Okay.  In the last two years, have you, has sort of figuring out right and wrong been hard, easy?
R:It’s been pretty easy.
I:Okay.  Has it been, knowing what’s right and wrong, sort of doing what’s right and wrong or figuring out how you’re gonna behave, has that been easy or hard or confusing or clear, or?
R:Doing what’s right and wrong, is always clear, but the doing part is never easy.
I:Okay, it isn’t.
R:I guess sometimes.
I:Why is that?
R:Because I have this nature that wants to do bad a lot.
I:You have a nature.
R:Yes.
I:That wants to do bad, why is that?
R:Because I am sinful, I’m a sinner.
I:You are.
R:Yes.
I:Uh-huh.  So you want to do the wrong thing?
R:Yes.  But you know to do what’s right.
I:But you still know that you should do what’s right.
R:Right.
I:I interview a lot of teens that say, oh, I know what’s right and wrong, I’m just not gonna do it, I’m gonna do what I wanna do.
R:That’s stupid.
I:Why?  Would What if? But?  they say I’m having fun or I don’t care or?
R:Because I, I don’t know, hopefully one day they’ll look and be like I was being stupid and I was wasting my life and because even if you’re having fun, there’s no fulfillment in it.  Because like you’re, you can have fun in the moment, but what are your future plans and what are your goals and what are you gonna do for the rest of your life, it’s just now and me and nothing else.
I:Well some of them would say, I’m not trying to convince you that they’re right, but some of them would say, no I’m having a great time and when I get older I’ll settle down and everything will be great.
R:I don’t know how they can really believe that.  But, I—
I:Because why, why are you skeptical of that?
R:Because I think that any life without God in it isn’t really fulfilling and then there’s no, like, purpose and for me that’s kind of sad and so for them to honestly think that they’re doing fine and like later they’ll be okay and I just don’t think that it’s going to turn out that way and if they’re having a good time now it’s not gonna be a good time later and like what about eternity?
I:Well they, what they say is I’ll figure that out later.
R:When’s later?  Who knows when they’re gonna die, they don’t know when they’re gonna die.
I:Okay.  Well, actually yesterday I interviewed somebody that said, I’m a pretty good person so I’m not, I don’t think I’m gonna be, I actually live pretty decently so I’m not worried about when I die.
R:But how, how, where do you draw the line, where is good and is the next person doing good and so you can ask them well, do you know, on a scale on 1 to 10 how good you have to be to get into heaven and where are you, and what if someone’s scale is different?
I:So you think there’s a line somewhere that you have to be on the one side of or something to be okay when you die?
R:Not, not like a line, but faith in Jesus and God, not, not it was more like an example, like if there was no God or Jesus then you have a scale.
I:I’ve also interviewed kids that say oh, yeah, I believe in God, I believe in Jesus but I’m also gonna do what I wanna do.
R:I, I have a friend like that and I didn’t know until like this summer and it, it like scares me because I’m worried for her and worried about what she’s gonna do with her life because even though they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do and have fun, there’s so much more and I know that she does stuff to just find fulfillment and nothing is working.
I:So what’s happening with her, what do you mean?  She didn’t, so she didn’t fully let you know how she’s living her life, and?
R:Yeah  I don’t think a lot of people did.  Because maybe they felt like I was gonna judge them or they didn’t want to tell me and I still really love them, but a lot of stuff, like I didn’t know until after school was out and like, probably like three weeks ago, like my friends that I was close with and they want, like them to do good and I care about them, but they’re just like trashing their lives by going to partying and getting drunk and having sex and I’m like, this is a Christian school, this is not supposed to happen!","Well, they intuitively know right and wrong because whether they want to believe it or not, everyone is created in God’s image and so because of that, we all have the right and wrong, and conscience, in us and, yeah.

Um, I think there’s a standard and there’s morals, whether people want to believe it or not and there’s a definite right and wrong.  And whether they get that from the Bible or from their family or the law, there is moral, there is morals and there is right and wrongs that people know not to steal because it’s illegal, but because our country was based on biblical principles and keep going way back and back and back and we were all created in God’s image and so we all have a sense of like, duty, um, and obligation, because we were created in God’s image and so whether people get their morals from the law, it all goes back to what God said for us. In the end, because ultimately, nothing else matters except for God. It can be. I think that it is. No, I don’t think that, just because the government makes a law, that’s God’s will.

R:Um, through the Bible.  Each circumstance that comes can be found somewhere in there.
I:Okay and so that’s your main thing you go to?
R:Right.
I:Okay and in general, do you think it is easy or hard for you to decide what’s right or wrong?
R:It’s usually pretty easy.  And if I have trouble deciding, I know what’s right, like I just don’t want to.
I:Do you think it’s become easier or harder to know what’s right or wrong as you get older?
R:Sometimes it’s harder, a lot of times it’s easier.  I don’t know, I think there, I think it’s the same.
I:It’s always the same?
R:Mm-hmm , sometimes stuff is more confusing or people are more involved now.  And okay, it’s probably harder because before when I was in high school, my parents were always like there so they could say everything and monitor everything but now I think it’s harder because now I'm being the one being like oh my parents told me I couldn’t go, like I don’t want to go, why don’t you want to go?  Because I don’t want to go.  So it’s me instead of them, so harder.
I:Yeah, you can't even say it was my parents.
R:Like there’s no blaming anybody else.
I:Okay and what is it that you think makes something right or wrong?  What is that thing that makes it a right or wrong thing?
R:Like a standard?
I:Yeah.
R:The ultimate standard I think is God’s word, the Bible.  So I think anything held up against that.
I:And what if you’re unsure about that?  You said like if you—
R:If you’re unsure I think you should seek wise counsel and godly counsel from people in your life.

I:It’s easy?  And as you get older do you think it gets easier or harder?
R:Sometimes it’s easier, sometimes it’s harder, it just depends on the situation, but-
I:Like as compared to when you were 19, was it harder or easier now that you’re 23?
R:It’s probably easier now.
I:What do you think makes it easier as you’re older?
R:When you’re younger you have peer pressure and you’re more concerned well what is this person going to think about me if I make this decision or what is this group of people going to think and you know once you get older you’re like I don’t really care what people think, you know?
I:Okay and so what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  What makes it a wrong thing or a right thing?
R:A wrong thing would be something that could possibly hurt me in any kind of way, financially, socially, just you know physically.  Any kind of way.","I would usually ask myself before doing something, I would ask myself tomorrow morning when I wake up, will I regret that?  And if the answer is yes than I won’t do it.

I:First let me ask you is it hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Um, I usually just, it’s kind of hard a little bit, yeah it’s uh, if I’m faced with uh, if a friend’s fighting with another friend but they have two good points of views, it’s kind of hard to find out who’s right and who’s wrong, that’s a big challenge.
I:Okay.  What else do you do to kind of, well do you have a moral compass?
R:Um, not really I would, I’m usually, I have my own sort of views on how to deal with it.
I:Okay tell me what some of those views are.
R:It depends on like, I don’t really know, it depends on the situations.
I:Okay what would be some of the determining factors?
R:Like if somebody was drinking of course, I have a view that drinking is bad, and I’d try to tell them not and if they were smoking I’d try to tell them smoking is bad.  Um, if they had relationship problems, I’d try to help them with that and put my point of view in there.
I:Alright.  Let me ask you a more general question, and maybe it will help you think more through this as well.  Uh, what do you think, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, huh, I’m not sure.
I:Okay some people may say it’s the consequences, some may say it’s based on what kind of consequences, maybe feelings, do you have, or is that a basis for your decision on what’s right or wrong or is it outside of those?
R:I think it’s the consequences.
I:Okay so you use consequences as a basis of what’s right or wrong, making your decisions?
R:Uh-huh.
I:Okay, can you give me an example?
R:Uh, if um, huh, I’ll go back to my drinking and stuff, you know if you smoke, I try to tell them that they’re going to get lung cancer, and emphazema, and when they drink they can like destroy your uh, liver.  I try to tell them the consequences to most of the things out there, maybe going out late, um, some people are out having sex, I try to tell them the consequences about that, and it usually doesn’t work but I still try.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Uh, basically from my mom.  And I’m kind of like her on the whole idea, cause she tries to teach me and tell me all the bad things in life.  But of course I’ve kind of chosen my ideas on what I think are right and wrong.
I:Where would you say you differ?  Can you give me any examples of that?
R:Um, huh, I don’t really have much a big difference on things, it would be political ideas, she has a lot, she’s very political and she made me become political but I have a few different views.  Um,
I:What are those differences?
R:Um, she, not, huh, what’s one?  I know I have one different view between me and her, uh, I think I’m not sure on her abortion idea, but I’m not really up for abortion, though she’s democratic, and she’s all about different civil rights.

In general…just um…you know think about what’s right, I just think about it, I mean is this like really right…I mean am I like…I don’t know.  I mean just like if the basic people think it’s right and wrong…basic laws I guess. Are the cars coming or are the cars not coming?  You know, just decide on that. Yeah.  Basically.  Like…yeah…your basic decisions, your brain working. Yeah, there’s common sense, that’s the word I was looking for. Think of the consequences. Yeah, because, consequences, I’m not going to go to the bible for every little decision I have to make, that’s something my mother would do (laughs), so you know, think of the consequences, if I do this or if I do that, what is it going to turn out like?  If I don’t do this what could happen.  Or if I don’t do this what could I miss out on, so I weigh out the options.","The respondent navigated a difficult decision regarding a friend's need for space versus support, ultimately relying on advice from her mother and youth group, while also expressing a belief that morality is rooted in religion and feeling guilty about her own selfishness in comparison to others' struggles.","I:How do decide or know what is good and bad or right and wrong in life?
R:It’s based on my interpretation of the Bible, because I don’t go by, because I don’t always go by what they interpret.  So based on what I interpret in the Bible.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:In general, easy.
I:Okay.  Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past few years?
R:Harder.
I:Why is that?
R:Because I’ve been faced with more challenging situations, like, um, I’ve been more, I’ve been exposed to the world more, like, more classes, more options, more freedom, more friends, more events, more activities, more of everything.  So, since you, if you’re really like clustered in a little place, it’s really easy to be like, oh well this is wrong and this is right.  But if you have all these things to choose from, you kind of like have to take a step back and think about it, so it’s kind of hard.
I:Okay.  What do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:What makes something right or wrong.  Mm.  Whoa, that’s a hard one.  What makes it—if, okay.  If you’re hurting someone, obviously, that’s wrong.  And if you’re hurting yourself, in any way, that’s wrong.  And basically if you’re not like loving your neighbor and like taking respect in any kind of like moral law, I don’t know what I’m trying to get at.  Like you know, the basic ones, like love your neighbor as yourself and try and like you know, be good to everybody.
I:Okay.  Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves?
R:Killing.  Stealing, obvious—well, no, actually, because if you’re like stealing to save your family, I guess like, I don’t know.  I know killing is.  Um, I have no idea.  I guess, everything has like a double standard to it.  Because, like, if you’re stealing to save your family from starvation, you kind of have to.  I know my Mom would probably say that’s wrong anyway, but in my opinion, you kind of have to, if you have to like save your family or something and if you have to like lie to save somebody’s life, then I think that’s, it’s okay in that sense.  In my Mom’s case, like she’d say like, no a lie is a lie.  And you should have like faith or like whatever that you’ll be saved anyway or you should have faith in God that he’s gonna provide food for you.  In my opinion, yet, if you don’t believe in God or you don’t have that kind of faith or those kind of resources, you gotta steal, you gotta steal.
I:Okay.  Um, where have you acquired your moral views?
R:The Bible.","It’s based on my interpretation of the Bible, because I don’t go by, because I don’t always go by what they interpret.  So based on what I interpret in the Bible. In general, easy.

R:My mom and um, religion I guess, also just like things that I’ve seen cause kids I don't know parents are oblivious but then kids are so oblivious, too, like they don’t, parents know more than they’ll show, like as much as they don’t know, they, they know a lot more than you think they know and they like um, I don't know like they know sometimes like when you’re lying, like right away, they’ll know and then like mothers always like I had you in here and I know what you felt like and I know when you’re lying and it’s like no you don’t, but sometimes they really do and I swear she can read my mind and I don't know but like, like I forgot what I was getting to.
I:Oh, that’s fine, um, let's see, so what do you think um, that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think if, if you’re not, I don't know that thing like if you’re not comfortable doing it around your parents, or someone you look up to if you don’t want them to see you do that, then it’s pretty much wrong.  But, if there’s like a consequences that could happen, you know like if you’re afraid of getting caught, you better not do it cause like you know there’s always that chance or it’s probably bad for you.
I:Uh-huh, where do you think they get their right and wrongs from?  I mean your parents?  Parents.
R:My parents, uh, I don't know much about my dad, but my mom definitely like life experience plus like I don't know I’m glad she doesn’t take after her grandma, I mean my grandma, cause my grandma is like really strict, like one time she heard that like she freaked out cause my friend, her name was Charlie, and like she was like Charlie, you’re friends with a boy and like I didn’t want to tell her who that actually was, now, cause she was like freaking out, no, no, no, it’s okay, it’s a girl, her name is just Charlie and like I’m glad my mom like doesn’t think like being friends with a guy is like freakishly wrong, because you know like how else are you going to be comfortable around them like later when you need that,
I:Right.
R:I don't know, but my mom gets it I guess from her parents, like a lot of things, but mostly it’s religion like she, she’s not into what her parents think any more, cause her parents never, I mean they care about her, they’ve done everything they could for her, but not it’s like now they only think bad of her and they think everything she does is negative so they don’t want, she doesn’t really like listen to them any more.
I:So do you think that right and wrong comes from like God, or do you think it comes from something else or what do you think?
R:I think it comes from whatever you believe in because people even people who are like atheist know what’s right and wrong, you know like if they don’t believe in God, like there’s this one girl who goes to my school, her name is like Lindy and she’s like I think they made up God cause they couldn’t explain scientific stuff you know that, it’s like why is that there, cause God, you know and like she doesn’t believe in that but she still believes like you know killing people is wrong, you know depriving someone of like life or depriving you know taking other people’s rights is wrong.
I:So what, how do you think she knows what’s right and wrong, like how, like what makes it right or wrong if she doesn’t believe in God, do you think?

How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Uh, your morals I guess, right?  Your morals, and then some of it I guess just common sense but like, that doesn’t really explain much, cause a lot of people are so non common sense.
I:Is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s usually easy, just doing is harder.  It’s like I know this is wrong, but I’m going to do it.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:It’s easier.  It’s easier because after a while you just realize it’s not even worth it.  It’s like, I don’t need to do anything that I don’t want to or have to.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  You said it’s usually easy to figure out what it is, but
R:Just if you ever have like a doubt that yeah, I should do it, or I shouldn’t, then yeah, usually it’s wrong, you know it’s just like, like if you don’t know for sure that it’s right, then most likely it’s wrong.  Cause I don’t know, it’s that whole little voice in your head thing, it’s like, would your mom be okay with it?
I:So do you think your morals have come from your mom?  Somewhat?
R:Not really from my mom, but, yeah, I guess maybe.
I:Okay.
R:It’s just like a cultural, family and yeah, since my mom’s been my cultural thing, (giggles0
I:No, that’s totally fine.  Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Always wrong, I think so, like no matter who does it?
I:Yeah, like no matter who does it.
R:Yeah, things like, murder and lying and cheating and stealing, any, any of those things, like even not like actions, but like being jealous and angry, all of those things are pretty much bad.
I:So why are those wrong in particular?
R:Just cause I don’t know, I think when you, when you have like jealousy it takes away from concentrating on good things you could have, like I don’t know, just like, all the time you take to think about how much you hate that one person and you wish they didn’t have all the things they have, just could be spent on working your way to getting those things, I don’t know, it’s just pointless, and it doesn’t do you any good.
I:So what about like killing and things like that, what is it about those that makes things wrong?
R:That’s just stupid.
I:I know it sounds like a stupid question, but when you think about it why do you think killing is wrong?
R:Why is killing wrong?  Because, because taking something, just taking the life of somebody else, or something else, it’s not yours to take away, you have no right to it. Even if it’s your life, you shouldn’t, because you, you didn’t give yourself life.  So why would you destroy something that it’s not yours to destroy.
I:Okay, so you said you’ve acquired your moral views from your mom and from your culture and that kind of thing.  So in what ways do you think?  Your religion?  Does that come in?
R:Religion, yeah, definitely.  Um, in what ways, um, I don’t know, like culturally, like I go to school with people and like maybe my best friends will like wear like, it’s not really that I think it’s wrong, it’s just that I don’t feel like comfortable doing it cause I just grew up in a family where like, yeah, I’m not going to wear like a headdress, like I’m just more comfortable wearing like pants, and like shorts, sure, but like a skirt that’s pretty, but not like my butt cheeks are going to hang out.  I just don’t feel comfortable.  Some people, are comfortable, look good in it, that’s okay, that’s you.  I just cant, I just don’t feel right.
I:So it’s kind of whatever is good for each person?
R:Yeah, just like, I mean it’s not like yes, oh please wear this, cause I like it when your butt cheeks hang out,

R:You know how they say would you do that in front of your mom, or would you do this and that.

I:So you think it is internal or is it more like telling your mom…or do you feel like your mom is a big…
R:I think it is both.  I think it is internal, like you are at ease with it.  It is ok with you, or do you kind of have an anxiety towards it.  And also how will you be perceived if you do this, so it is both.
I:And when you say perceived you don’t just necessarily mean in general by the outer world, but you mean people close to you?
R:Yeah.  I mean it is outer world as well.  It depends on the situation.  You don’t want to always give the wrong impression to a big group of people either.  Or people that don’t know you that will automatically form an opinion about you because the people who know you better won’t necessarily change their opinion about you based on one thing.

R:It’s easy to decide what is right and wrong.  It’s harder to decide whether you want to still do it or not.  I can know it is wrong, but I can say to myself is it something that is this much wrong but I can do it and not feel totally guilty or it won’t effect other things, or is it kind of like the one wrong where it will send everything into a wack…there are certain things, like is it a wrong that I will get away with or is it a wrong that is going to come bite me later?
I:So it is consequences versus how you feel inside?
R:Yeah.
I:They are two different things?
R:Yeah.
I:Do you think it’s gotten harder or easier as you’ve gotten older to make those decisions?
R:It gets easier I think.  Well it gets easier to a point because you are not as afraid it.  I think when you get older everything spreads out.  Your friends aren’t going to school with you all of them.  You are not always in the same classrooms and word doesn’t spread as quickly.  They are not as involved in all aspects of your life.  You have a job here and you have friends here, you go home here.  So you can kind of make the right decision and not everybody has to know you are a loser that made the wrong decision so you tend to look more inward than look outwards as you get older.

R:Mmm, my parents.  The Bible, what I feel is right and wrong, you know, moral standards that I have within myself.  What I think is a standard for me.
I:Is it, in general, difficult or easy for you?
R:It’s not, it’s not hard at all, you know, because certain things that just won’t find myself in.

I:Has it gotten easier or more difficult?
R:Oh, it’s easier.  It’s much easier now.  I think it’s easier because like, before I thought it would have been like, like risky, too risky for me, you know, and what would be the consequence, but that was just me, the young me thinking, but now, you know, I sit back and I look at the whole situation, weigh all the options and I’m like, well this seems to be the best option for me so I’m gonna go this route.

R:Wow, how you feel about it.  If, I, I go by my gut feeling.  It’s something within me.  It’s always different for different people, you know, but I think there’s like, a like a general standard for people because, you know, everyone thinks like killing people is wrong and stealing is wrong, you know what I’m saying, but it comes down to the individual as far as more personal things are concerned.  What do you feel is right or wrong?  How does it affect you, how does it affect people around you?
I:Where do you think the feelings come from, in your view?
R:I don’t know, I can’t, I can’t even do that.  I don’t know.  I can’t explain that, there’s just within me because I look at it based on how it’s gonna affect me in the long run, how’s it gonna affect people around me.

R:I categorize it based on if, how I feel about it.  If it’s gonna hurt someone, if it’s gonna hurt me, if I would want that done to me, if I want someone to experience that, depending if it’s bad or good, that’s how I would categorize it.
I:In general, would you say it’s easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:No.  It’s really easy for me, actually.
I:Why do you feel it’s easy?
R:Because like, like I don’t know.  It’s just something in you.  Like you know what’s good or what’s bad.  Obviously if something’s gonna affect you adversely it’s bad.  If it’s gonna be for the positive, it’s good and I try to keep myself in a lot of black and white, no gray areas.  I mean, there are times when it’s gonna come to gray areas but like stuff like religion and beliefs and stuff, that’s what comes up.

Would I want someone else to do this, like would I want to do this and get away with it if no one knew, stuff like that.  A lot of times I do the right thing.
I:And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past couple years?
R:It’s gotten easier, to some extent.  I paid for it the other day by pulling over.

So, I did the right thing, not necessarily the best thing I guess, at that time, but it was the right thing.
I:Have your views changed in the past couple of years, like your moral views?
R:No.  If anything, it got more sound because I am getting older now, I’ve experienced more things, put myself in certain situations where deciding whether right or wrong, or morally sound is right, I would tend to like think that I’m better off doing things that I feel is morally correct, so it’s easy.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Well, a lot of the times it’s personal, it changes from person to person.  What you may think is right may not necessarily be right for me, understand?  So it’s all individual.  As far as that’s concerned, but there’s some cases where you have to, of course it’s gonna be right, it’s gonna be wrong, as far as like hurting people or getting hurt or doing something that’s gonna cause someone some negative effect.
I:So for you, what makes something right or wrong, is it like rules, laws, consequences, how it feels, I mean?
R:How it feels.  You know, I’m very logical.  I look at it logically.  Is this gonna be better for the situation or worse?  Obviously, if it’s worse, it’s gonna be wrong.  If it’s better, all go.
I:So it’s usually the consequences.
R:Yeah, the consequences, you know?  And how I feel, too.

R:I’d say most of that for me is generally guided by religion.  I look at most things for a moral I should know, read the Bible, figure it out.  Everything for me is based off of love God, love other people.  If anything is in contradiction to that, then it’s bad.
I:How hard or easy is it for you to know right and wrong, good and bad?
R:The big stuff,  and that’s an issue for me that I’m trying to research and find out, but if it comes to the sense that it doesn’t necessarily state it and it doesn’t go against my love God, love your neighbor, then it’s okay.
I:Is there a specific Bible verse or passage that says women shouldn’t wear jewelry?
R:There is one that people use a lot, but it also says not to basically tattoos, but it
I:2 Timothy, or something like that?
R:Yeah, but it also says that women shouldn’t braid your hair, so obviously people still braid their hair, so there’s gotta be something bigger behind that, and why that was said, and I’m not exactly clear on that, but I
I:There’s another passage that says women shouldn’t speak in church, but ask their husbands after they get home, so does the Adventist church enforce that or teach that?
R:Not not speaking in church, but we don’t support women as pastors, so that’s something.
I:You may have already answered this, but what is it that you think makes things right or wrong, or morally good or bad?  You referred to teachings in the Bible, but what is it that makes that?
R:I think that it all goes down to my beliefs about good to be right or wrong, so for me because I believe that God created the universe, and the universe is governed by his character, and therefore, his character is good and everything outside of that is bad, so if his character is the character of love and mercy and all of that, then anything outside of that is bad.  That’s my plausible explanation, and in the Bible that has a lot more specific examples that I can look at for reference.
I:And the way that’s communicated or revealed is in the Bible?
R:In the Bible, I don’t know, in people’s experiences, in life.
I:Why do you think the Bible is written in so many different genres?  It’s quasi-historical.  It’s proverbs.  It’s theological writing.  It’s worship.  Why didn’t God just put together the boy scout and girl scout manual for life, and here it is, plain and simple?  It can be complicated in the Bible.  You have to pull out and sort through and figure out, and why is that?
R:I think to think because made human , and that’s not very interesting at all, and I think that, well, I don’t know.  Reading a story and learning a lesson from a story that’s written in the Bible, it’s a lot easier to learn from, and having someone say here it is, cuz why would I ask about why, why not?
I:But it also says, don’t do this too.
R:Well yeah, but then it has all those examples of why not do, and I think proverbs and psalms and stuff like that.  I like to think they’re there because there are different, everything’s different, and we all have different ways of, different personalities and different ways of worshipping.  For me specifically, I’m really touched by words, and I love poetry and I love writing, so me reading psalms is just wonderful.  Reading  as much, so I think that there are all sorts of different writings, genres like you said, it’s easier, you touch more people that way.
I:Okay.  What do you think about the fact that people who believe the Bible and believe it’s authority and it teaches God’s will and so on seem to interpret it so many different ways.  You can find any issue and it seems like there are three or four different readings about which people argue and fight and split and create separate denominations, and how do you?  The question essentially is, how can something be an authority that everybody reads in so many different ways?
R:Very good question.
I:I’m not trying to undercut its authority.  It’s an interesting question for me.
R:No, no, I know.  It is interesting.  Even within denominations, there’s debates and interpret it differently.  It was written people, and people aren’t perfect.  You can edit something a thousand times, and there would still be mistakes and stuff, which obviously, and there’s one story that’s told a couple different times in the Bible, and there’s little details changed, and it’s been translated however many times.
I:But even apart from details, some Episcopalians right now are in a mess about American Episcopalians want to ordain gay bishops, and then obviously other denominations are like, what in the world are you talking about?  Do you think everyone has to do their best and it’ll shake out in the end, or do you think some people are wrong, or do you think God wants a whole variety of things?
R:I think, it’s hard because 7th Day Adventists normally tend to have the attitude that we’re right and everyone else is wrong.  I don’t think that’s necessarily true because, just from history, tons of different religions of people have had that attitude, and it turns out they’ve been wrong.  They’ve done horrible things, and the problem is, I think that everybody probably has a piece of the truth, but we’re trying to make God a lot smaller than he is, and trying to dictate every aspect of everything, and either this is right or wrong, or this is right or wrong, and it’s harder than that.  You can’t say jewelry is right or wrong because it goes deeper than that.  What’s behind that?  Why would it be bad?  How could it be bad?  Because if you take it too hard, it becomes an idol, and the most important thing in you life, if you spend all your money on that, but it’s easier for them to say that it’s wrong, so I think people, I don’t know, just in an effort to make  seem more controlling and more ordinary as to religious creed, some of these boundaries that they derive from the Bible supposedly, more like a couple verses here and there.
I:Do you, so different people are raised differently, and you were raised one way, and that’s mostly what you’re going with, and do you believe that’s mostly the right way and that’s the proper interpretation of Scripture?  Do you feel like that’s what you have, what else are you going to do?  Do you not really want to think about it, or what?
R:As far as I have been on my own, most of the core beliefs that I’ve grown up with are still true as far as I stand.
I:And a lot of other denominations would agree with those.
R:A lot of other denominations have
I:Pardon me?
R:Ellen White, have you heard of her?  She’s a prophet in 1844.  Anyway, there’s this big whole thing, and so a lot of people, she wrote a lot of books.  They’re really inspiring, and maybe inspired a belief that she was spoken to by God.   a lot of people in my denomination is that people will take what she says a lot more than they would, say, read the Bible, so that’s where I split from a lot of people in my church.","I’d say most of that for me is generally guided by religion.  I look at most things for a moral I should know, read the Bible, figure it out.  Everything for me is based off of love God, love other people.  If anything is in contradiction to that, then it’s bad. The big stuff,  and that’s an issue for me that I’m trying to research and find out, but if it comes to the sense that it doesn’t necessarily state it and it doesn’t go against my love God, love your neighbor, then it’s okay. There is one that people use a lot, but it also says not to basically tattoos, but it Yeah, but it also says that women shouldn’t braid your hair, so obviously people still braid their hair, so there’s gotta be something bigger behind that, and why that was said, and I’m not exactly clear on that, but I Not not speaking in church, but we don’t support women as pastors, so that’s something.  I think that it all goes down to my beliefs about good to be right or wrong, so for me because I believe that God created the universe, and the universe is governed by his character, and therefore, his character is good and everything outside of that is bad, so if his character is the character of love and mercy and all of that, then anything outside of that is bad.  That’s my plausible explanation, and in the Bible that has a lot more specific examples that I can look at for reference. In the Bible, I don’t know, in people’s experiences, in life. I think to think because made human , and that’s not very interesting at all, and I think that, well, I don’t know.  Reading a story and learning a lesson from a story that’s written in the Bible, it’s a lot easier to learn from, and having someone say here it is, cuz why would I ask about why, why not? Well yeah, but then it has all those examples of why not do, and I think proverbs and psalms and stuff like that.  I like to think they’re there because there are different, everything’s different, and we all have different ways of, different personalities and different ways of worshipping.  For me specifically, I’m really touched by words, and I love poetry and I love writing, so me reading psalms is just wonderful.  Reading  as much, so I think that there are all sorts of different writings, genres like you said, it’s easier, you touch more people that way. Very good question. No, no, I know.  It is interesting.  Even within denominations, there’s debates and interpret it differently.  It was written people, and people aren’t perfect.  You can edit something a thousand times, and there would still be mistakes and stuff, which obviously, and there’s one story that’s told a couple different times in the Bible, and there’s little details changed, and it’s been translated however many times. I think, it’s hard because 7th Day Adventists normally tend to have the attitude that we’re right and everyone else is wrong.  I don’t think that’s necessarily true because, just from history, tons of different religions of people have had that attitude, and it turns out they’ve been wrong.  They’ve done horrible things, and the problem is, I think that everybody probably has a piece of the truth, but we’re trying to make God a lot smaller than he is, and trying to dictate every aspect of everything, and either this is right or wrong, or this is right or wrong, and it’s harder than that.  You can’t say jewelry is right or wrong because it goes deeper than that.  What’s behind that?  Why would it be bad?  How could it be bad?  Because if you take it too hard, it becomes an idol, and the most important thing in you life, if you spend all your money on that, but it’s easier for them to say that it’s wrong, so I think people, I don’t know, just in an effort to make  seem more controlling and more ordinary as to religious creed, some of these boundaries that they derive from the Bible supposedly, more like a couple verses here and there.

R:I think for the most part the things that are right and wrong are clear-cut and the things that are gray; that is, where you have to use your intuition put yourself in situations and look at long term.  If you go with this decision how is it going to affect your life later on and then something really serious enters the relationship I pray on it and see what happens from there.
I:So you use a combination depending on the situation is that what you’re saying.
R:Yeah, you’re right.
I:Is it generally hard or easy for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I mean of course, there is temptation in everything.  There are things that are definitely wrong that I choose not to do.
I:I don’t mean necessarily doing right; I just meant deciding between right and wrong.
R:Things are pretty clear-cut for me.  Give me a situation, is there a specific –
I:No, I just meant in general, deciphering between right and wrong, knowing what’s right and wrong.  Do you feel it’s pretty easy or –
R:Yeah.
I:And has that gotten easier or harder the last couple of years?
R:Easier, you know, you see people have chosen certain routes and you see how they end up with certain decisions that they make and you have to keep that in your memory bank.  And then when it’s your turn to decide, you can see what other people have done and see what happens to them and then – so I think it becomes easier.  Then it also become harder too because you’re so educated and you see so many different things and then you’re questioning some of your beliefs.  I think that’s where faith comes in.
I:You mentioned education, do you think that has to do with an education?
R:Well see when you’re educated, it opens so many different doors so many different influences so many factors come in and it’s not all, “okay this is what you were taught when you were young and that’s it.”  Then again, you have to have certain beliefs that I think are your foundation that I think you can build upon.
I:Okay.  Now for you, what makes something right or wrong?
R:I am going to go into some philosophical stuff
I:I mean is it the rules, the laws, the consequences is it how it feels, the Gods will is it something else?
R:I mean God's will plays a role in it but also the rules of the laws of the land and all.  Also if you feel shaky about it there’s got to be something wrong.  When in doubt, don’t do it.
I:So you recognize some of the feelings like what kind of feelings?
R:Like guilt, guilt is the biggest one.
I:What role do you think guilt plays?
R:A big part I think, because you have to live with yourself every day.
I:Where do you think that comes from?
R:Guilt?  Your conscious, some people are more immune to it than others and more people are susceptible to it.  Other people who can’t live with a guilty conscious who would be more reluctant to do certain things than other people.  I think the conscious is also your upbringing as well.
I:Where do you think you acquired your moral views?

I:Uh-hu.
R:….but, like, rob an old man because someone that you know is, like, dying and has no money and needs medicine or something, then it’s like, well, maybe it’s not so wrong.

R:So, just--you just have to kind of go with it….
I:Yeah.  In general, how hard or easy do you think it is to figure out what’s right or wrong?
R:I mean, in general, like in everyday situations, I think it’s really easy to figure out what’s right or wrong.  But, you know, there’s some situations that it’s, like, really tough.

I:Okay.  Uhm, so what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Well, I think a big part of it is, uhm, society, and it just depends on the time and what’s going on socially, like, in the world, in the country, like, where you are, or maybe in your group of friends, or….
I:Uh-hu.
R:…and, like, your family and stuff, like, I don’t think it--it just changes.  I think it changes a lot.
I:Uhm, what kind of things do you think are behind it, though, even if it’s changing—what’s--any given situation, what kind of things do people rely on to figure out what’s right or wrong?
R:Well, I don’t know.  Like I kind of said before, I think people just kind of feel it.

I:Uh-hu.
R:Like, nobody wants to make anybody feel bad, in general.  You know, nobody wants to, like, hurt anybody or do something that could hurt somebody.  So, I think that has a lot to do with it, even if some situations with right or wrong have nothing to do with people getting hurt.  So…
I:Uh-hu.  Where do you think most feelings come from?
R:Well, I guess, society, kind of, and, like, upbringing, and, like, I mean, so many things, like TV, like media--media, and, like, family and religion are pounded into your head ever since you can think, pretty much and pretty much molds people, sort of.  So…
I:Okay.  Do you think there are any actions that are always wrong?
R:Well, I think hurting people.  I think hurting people is always wrong, or not helping someone if they’re in a hurting situation and you could help them.  I think that’s always wrong.  And, like, that can--that pretty much covers a lot of stuff, you know what I mean?  And, so…
I:Okay.  Uhm, from where have you acquired your moral views?  Where did they come from?
R:My parents, a lot from my parents, and, of course, media and my friends, and family.

R:um, well. Do you want the person answer? Or the student answer?  Do you want the sociology student answer? Or like the personal answer?
I:The personal.
R:Um, I mean I would definitely say I just kinda figure it out, but the person is still the student, so I can’t separate that.  So I would say I don’t really figure that much out and basically a lot of stuff that influences me, whether I notice it or not.  I mean, my parents, obviously, like the way I was raised.  You know.  My friends sort of, we’re all kinda the same so. Um, stuff I learn at school definitely influences me a lot. Like my professors I would say influence me a lot definitely and of course there’s like media stuff which is like influencing me right now and I don’t even know it.
I:Are you sure that was the personal and not sociology answer?
R:I mean yeah, like I said, the person is the student, it’s hard to separate that, I mean if I like had to make a decision about something and I couldn’t make up my mind, I would probably talk to Mellie*, who’s my girlfriend, or I would talk to my roommate.

So I feel like my mom, it’s always like a permission thing and I’m like I’m not asking for your permission, I don’t live with you, I have my own money for things and I have my own life, I’m just asking for your opinion.  So I would ask like friends and family.  Um, but I am definitely really influenced by a lot of the stuff I read for school and a lot of the stuff I learn in class.
I:and in general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong.
R:I don’t think it’s not that hard, usually it’s sometimes, you just have like a gut feeling, even if that really is being influenced by everything around you or sort of like, even if I make a decision on my own, you hear different people’s voices and I think right and wrong’s pretty simple, except when there is no right and wrong.  But that’s simple, too, because it’s just not there.
I:And do you think it’s gotten easier or harder over the last few years?
R:I think it’s been the same.
I:Yeah?
R:Mmhmm.
I:and what do you think makes something right or wrong, like you mentioned talking to your friends and family but you also said that sometimes you might be disagree with that..?
R:I mean the best way to figure out if something is right or wrong is to just sit and think about it by yourself and then whatever decision you come to, maybe it’s not, maybe someone else might come to a different decision, but that’s what you think is right for you or wrong for you.  But even when you sit alone, well what would this person say, what would that person say? I don’t know, so.
I:so when you’re trying to make a decision what kinds of things are you thinking about? Like what kind of consequences?
R:Like how will this affect me and how will this affect the people around me and maybe even if I won’t benefit, maybe a lot of people around me will benefit from it.  Like I need to make a decision and what I choose can harm people around me, then I’m probably not gonna do it.  Because I wouldn’t want to do that.","um, well. Do you want the person answer? Or the student answer?  Do you want the sociology student answer? Or like the personal answer? Um, I mean I would definitely say I just kinda figure it out, but the person is still the student, so I can’t separate that.  So I would say I don’t really figure that much out and basically a lot of stuff that influences me, whether I notice it or not.  I mean, my parents, obviously, like the way I was raised.  You know.  My friends sort of, we’re all kinda the same so. Um, stuff I learn at school definitely influences me a lot. Like my professors I would say influence me a lot definitely and of course there’s like media stuff which is like influencing me right now and I don’t even know it. I mean yeah, like I said, the person is the student, it’s hard to separate that, I mean if I like had to make a decision about something and I couldn’t make up my mind, I would probably talk to Mellie*, who’s my girlfriend, or I would talk to my roommate.

R:You don’t. I tend to overanalyze everything, but I usually do whatever makes the most sense, and it seems like it isn’t going to have that many drawbacks. Try not to act impulsively. If something bad comes up I deal with it then.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s usually pretty easy. I mean, not everything’s that cut and dried; even when it is, it’s pretty easy.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Easier.
I:Why?
R:I’m just stronger now than I was then.
I:Have your views changed about what’s right and wrong in the past two years?
R:I don’t think my views have changed. I think I’m a little bit more aware of things. It makes it easier to see things clearly.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I couldn’t say.
I:Is it rules or laws?
R:Sort of man-made.
I:What about consequences?
R:Maybe sometimes. Probably insofar as rules and laws, though.
I:How it feels?
R:I almost want to say yes but not necessarily, because whether that’s true or not, it may depend on your state of mind. Because things that felt right to me a couple of years ago were bad ideas but I wasn’t in much of a state of mind to be feeling anything so it’s kind of hard to tell whether I might regret it later or not.
I:Some people say “God’s will.”
R:If that’s what they believe, it’s not my belief. People have the freedom of choice.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:I guess somewhat the family that I was close to when I was little. My aunt, a little bit of my mother, my grandfather before he died, I’m sure—everybody says we were close. I can’t remember. Other than that, just my life.
I:Where do you think morals in general come from? Like do they exist out there somewhere or… you know what I mean?
R:There’s so many different types, just so many different morals, I don’t think it’s possible that they just exist out there. People make them for themselves, or let others make it for them if they aren’t competent enough to make their own.
I:So there are multiple moralities kind of out there?
R:Yes.
I:Are you saying each person created their own morality?
R:To an extent, I guess so.
I:What’s the limit to that?
R:Actually, I have no idea.","You don’t. I tend to overanalyze everything, but I usually do whatever makes the most sense, and it seems like it isn’t going to have that many drawbacks.

I:Okay, so do you think it’s actually wrong, is, is—
R:Yeah, it actually, I think it’s right, like if the kid wants to go, let him go.
I:Mm, okay, um, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I decided and just say okay, I’m doing this and I just think it’s right.","My, my Mom, well, our religion. Just what you, like what you choose it to be. Like um, going off with your friends to like maybe Payson to a party all night without telling your Mom and stuff and doing all that weird stuff. Yeah, cause it’s what his parents do, I don’t really care.  If his parents say he can go— I’d just say, you come if you want, but if you get grounded by your parents, don’t blame us.

Um, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, or what is right and wrong in life?
R:Ah, just like would I be happy if I made this choice or not.
I:Okay, is that pretty easy or kind of difficult for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Kind of difficult.
I:And how so?
R:Ah, like some things, like if you choose it, it would be like fun at the time, but then afterwards you’ll be, you get consequences or something, so it wouldn’t be that fun, just stuff like that.
I:Okay.  And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or has it gotten harder over the past two years?
R:It’s gotten easier.
I:And why is that, do you think?
R:Just because, just with my Mom and Dad’s help and stuff, they teach me pretty good on what’s good and bad.
I:Oh, okay.  Okay.  Um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, I just don’t know.
I:You don’t know, okay.  Um, so I wondered if it’s rules or laws?  Maybe, consequences?  Or how it feels?  Would it be God’s will?  Or something else altogether?
R:Probably rules and laws.
I:Okay.  And any rules and laws that come to mind?  Like, you’re talking legal, like you know, laws of the land, laws of the country type of thing, or any other rules that come to mind?
R:Ah, laws of the land and parents’ rules.
I:Okay.  Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Um, no.
I:No, okay.
R:No.
I:So it’s the situation that makes something right or wrong, you’re saying?
R:Yeah.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Um, my Mom and Dad.","Ah, just like would I be happy if I made this choice or not. Kind of difficult.

So, how do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:Just by families, like you’re going to look at it and see like, “Okay, if I do that there is going to be bad consequences.  If I do that there could be good consequences.”
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide?
R:If it’s like off the moment, it’s kind of hard.  But if I can like see it and then take time before I do it, that’s pretty easy.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Easier.
I:Why do you think that?
R:Just because I’ve been through a lot, like everything lately and stuff.
I:Have any of your views about these issues changed in the past two years?
R:Not really.
I:I see.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it’s your personal belief on what’s right or wrong.
I:Like, what do you mean by that? Can you tell me what that mean?
R:Some people might think this is not bad but then something else is bad.  To other people it’s just like...let’s just say like drinking.  To some people it’s bad and other people like, “Oh, that’s not bad, killing somebody is bad.”
I:If so, let’s say two people disagree about something.  Is it possible that one of them is like more right than the other one or is it just what’s right for one person is right for one person and what’s right for another person is right for another person?
R:What’s right for one person is right…because everybody is different.  There’s like, maybe you could find maybe some that are the same but everybody is different. Everybody will say they’re right, so just one person.
I:Where do you think you got your moral views, your views about right and wrong? Where do you think you got this from?
R:From a lot of different people, some from my parents and some from my friends.  It’s a little bit different but…
I:How do you think you sort of pick them up and get them? I mean, how do you learn them?
R:Like sometimes being put in a situation and then sometimes my parents taught me and stuff.","Just by families, like you’re going to look at it and see like, “Okay, if I do that there is going to be bad consequences.

I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?

I:Where do you think that feeling comes from?

I:Okay.  Do you think everyone has that feeling or only some people, or only a few people?

R:Um.  Like if I just feel like that’s the right thing to do, then, it’s within myself.  Um.  For instance, um, underage drinking.  Ah, I do it.
I:I noticed there’s a lot of beer bottles out on the sidewalk and a bunch of booze on top of the refrigerator .
R:Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  Um.
I:But some people would say, that’s a legal issue, not a moral issue.
R:Right, well, legal, legal issues come in hand with moral issues.
I:Yeah, okay.
R:Um, moral issues, maybe more sensitive, um.  Like stealing, killing.
I:I mean, it could be anything from you know cheating, stealing, um, taking advantage of women who have drunk too much, to just being good and kind and gracious, I mean, you know, it could be a whole range of virtues and character traits, you know?

I:So you’re saying you have sort of like an internal conscience that you rely on?
R:Right, yeah.
I:And how, where do you think that, what’s that based on or where does that come from?
R:Just living, you know?  A lot to do with your parental influence.  You like—
I:So some of it is what your parents taught.
R:It’s, it’s, it comes from your parents, friends, you take, try to take the good out of everybody, you know.

R:Um, that’s your own personal judgment.  Um, also like, like these guys, I talk with them a lot about that, we always have these kind of talks like, and you know like I think being honest and straightforward with like, everybody know, everybody would know what I think is right and what I think was wrong, and that’s, that’s how I like to, I like to be open about how, what I think is right and what I think is wrong.  And that way you’ll get feedback and like maybe alter a few things.
I:Do you think most people, or all people have a similar moral conscience, that’s reliable?
R:Reliable?
I:I mean, that, we know there are some psychopaths that they don’t have any conscience.
R:Right, right.
I:And we have some people whose consciences are so screwed up that they shouldn’t rely on them.  Like they need the law or police or whatever to keep them, but do you think for, the majority of people, pretty much know what’s right and wrong, and their conscience pretty much tells them or do you think, you know, some people do because they’ve had good training, they’ve had good parents, they’ve had, and other people are lost, you know, I mean, they need--?

I:So what is it that makes things morally right or wrong, ultimately?
R:What makes--?  There is no, there is no definite answer for that, but I feel…there’s no definite answer.

I:So people should know, they should be able to know what’s right.

R:No.  I'm sure a little bit – no, not really.  Not that I can –
I:Okay.  So what is it that you think makes something right or wrong?
R:What society has evolved to claim what is right and wrong.  So, like, back then, slavery was accepted; it wasn’t considered wrong.
I:But was it wrong in your eyes?

R:Maybe, maybe it's the rules, and the law.
I:Or the consequences, or how it feels? God's will? Something else, do you think?

So how do you normally decide or know what's good and bad, right and wrong?
R:I ask God.  If I can't – if it's not completely obvious as far as what I should do and what I shouldn’t do, I ask God.  And eventually, it'll become clear to me, you know?  I can't say I have all the answers, because I don't.  Sometimes I do try to determine what is the right and what's wrong, and if I make a mistake, then I just suffer my consequences and go and just move on.  So I if I really had – you know, some people be like, ""Oh, I asked my mom,"" but I couldn’t do that, so I'd just pray about it.
I:So in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It's not very hard.  Depending on the circumstances, if it's a situation I have never been in, I guess like dating this guy – I've never been in a situation like that, I've never dated a guy with kids before in my life, so it was hard for me to determine what was right and wrong.  And I just had to kind of play it by ear, and if I made a mistake, apologize for it or ask for forgiveness or whatnot.  But if I had no idea, I'd just pray.
I:And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder in the last few years?
R:It's gotten easier.  I think one thing that's kind of easy about it is not making a quick decision.  Like when I was younger, I wouldn’t think things through all the time, so I'd, you know, just react instead of, you know, think about what I'm about to do.  So I think it's gotten easier for me over a couple of years.
I:And what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I guess whatever was taught – I guess – when I have to decide on what's right or wrong, I think about the church, you know?  I think about what my pastor said or the bible or stuff like that.  That determines to me what's right and wrong, but  at the same time, because sometimes I think everything is just too strict, and they want us to just walk, you know, a certain way and it's not as easy as it sounds, so.","I ask God.

R:Um, my mom.
I:Your mom, uh-huh.
R:Yeah, cause she tells me what’s right and what’s wrong.  Sometimes I disagree with her, but then she has her reasons.
I:So do you usually talk with her, I don’t agree with that mom, does she tell you why, or what happens?
R:Um, yeah.
I:Or do you just sort of take her word for it?
R:Um, sometimes like mostly me and my mom agree about everything, the only thing I like disagree with her about is like the guys and talking to them. And like you get a bad name and I’m like okay, that’s the only thing I disagree with her.
I:But you still listen to her.
R:yeah, I still listen to her.
I:So, what do you think it is that makes something inherently right or wrong?  So, why is stealing wrong?
R:I think it’s wrong cause um, like when you steal, it’s like I don’t know, you’re stealing out of somebody’s like, you know, they’re making money and like they’re paying for the stuff and you just take it out with out paying for anything, so…
I:So you’re hurting somebody else.
R:Yeah, it’s basically you’re hurting somebody else and like you’re hurting yourself, too, because I don’t know, but like, if I steal something, I know sooner or later, I’ll feel really bad and I’ll probably like go up to the person and I’ll give them money or something or I’ll give it back to them.
I:How about something that doesn’t hurt somebody else…like I’m gonna sit here and do drugs…that doesn’t hurt you…but is that wrong?
R:No…it’s wrong cause you’re just hurting yourself with that.
I:So it’s wrong to hurt yourself and other people?
R:Um…it’s well, you’ll feel really bad and stupid on the choices that you made.  And then, like, I don’t know, but I think some people do feel bad even though they don’t admit it.  They’ll feel bad because like your parents don’t like when you do drugs and they get really disappointed and they’re really sad and I think sometimes you’ll feel really bad why you did that and but my mom says that if I do drugs, she’ll do everything to stop me but she’ll feel really sad for me.  And, she said like I’m not gonna be hurting her, but she’ll be really sad for me, but she always tells me I’ll be hurting myself and ruining my goals that I made already.
I:So you think it’s wrong to do things and hurt other people, hurt yourself, are there any other things, like um, anything else that makes something wrong?
R:Um, no.
I:So, how do you decide or know what’s good and bad, right and wrong in life?  So everyday, you have to make decisions, so…how do you what’s wrong and right, good and bad?
R:Um, usually, I think it over, like, my mom tells me what’s right for me usually a lot, and so I go from her opinions a lot like right now, I want to finish my high school here earlier.  So like next summer, my mom’s gonna be taking me to her, cause she works at a college, and I’ll be taking college classes so I can finish my classes earlier there.
I:And why do you want to do that?
R:Um, I want to be ahead of my self right now.  I want to be ahead of everything so I can graduate earlier from high school and I want to go to college and I have to go to more medical school so I think I’ll be really old by the time I finish all that stuff…
I:Yeah, you’ll be like my age…that’s pretty old.
R:So…I was like…I want to be young, still.","Um, I wouldn’t think it’s right, but again, like, it’s your choice, and I’m not the one who’s gonna be in trouble for that stuff, so… I would tell you it’s not right… I would tell you it’s…wrong.  Cause that’s what my like…my friend is tempted to grab stuff all of the time but I was like okay, think of it this way you’re gonna get in so much trouble and you’re gonna lose your trust with your mom.  And she’s like yeah, that’s right and that’s like usually when we go home and eat, cause we don’t have money sometimes. Um, my mom. Yeah, cause she tells me what’s right and what’s wrong.  Sometimes I disagree with her, but then she has her reasons. Um, yeah. Um, sometimes like mostly me and my mom agree about everything, the only thing I like disagree with her about is like the guys and talking to them.

I:Uh-huh so it doesn’t sound like there’s one source that you can think of as going to,
R:No.
I:Yeah.  Is it um, something that you, you feel or you think through or you look at uh,
R:Well generally, there’s just an intuitive feeling of is this right or is this wrong, and if you’re unsure then you kind of think through it.
I:Uh-huh.  Is there anything that you can pinpoint and say this is a reason why things are right and wrong?
R:I don’t suppose you have an example of something like that?
I:Um, let’s see, let’s see, um, something that makes something right and wrong, well, let’s see, what have we, some people will talk about um, uh, well of course you have, you know people who have appeals to the bible or something, you know that could be an example or you know other people might appeal to um, importance of relationships or um, anything like that?
R:Not that I can think of.
I:So um, I think, we’ve kind of touched on this but I realize it’s a really difficult thing to figure out, for the most part, we’re living, not thinking about everything, but how do you decide or know what’s good and bad, what is right and wrong in life?
R:Um, well one big one is how it affects other people and if you’re using other people or if you’re doing something that you know has a bad affect on other people then that’s not good.

I'd like to think that I’ve pretty much come up with it by myself, but I’m sure there’s tons of different factors that have affected why I think as I do, yeah. No. Well generally, there’s just an intuitive feeling of is this right or is this wrong, and if you’re unsure then you kind of think through it. I don’t suppose you have an example of something like that? Not that I can think of. Um, well one big one is how it affects other people and if you’re using other people or if you’re doing something that you know has a bad affect on other people then that’s not good. Um, no, not really.","The respondent believes that while morality can be seen as relative, they rely on an intuitive sense of right and wrong, influenced by their concern for how their actions affect others and the desire not to disappoint their parents academically, while also expressing a clear stance against drug use and cheating, although they acknowledge the complexity of lying in certain situations.","I:I see, uh-huh, yeah.  And um, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Um.  I think a lot of it is just common sense.  I don’t know.  It’s certainly not based off any religious feeling or anything like that.
I:Yeah, so common sense.  And in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s generally pretty easy.
I:Has it gotten easier or harder over the last couple years?
R:Um.  Well I’m not, I don’t really find myself in a lot of situations, debating about what’s right or wrong, aside from very theoretical things, so.  It’s pretty much the same.
I:Okay, haven’t come across, okay.  Ah, let’s see.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um.  Well I think it has to do with the impact that it has on other people, in general.  I mean, if it has a negative impact, it’s probably wrong.
I:Yeah.  Any, any, how would you describe those kinds of impacts or those consequences that would make something wrong?  Any particular kinds of impacts?
R:Um, I’m not really sure what you mean by that.
I:Mm.  Um, yeah, like if you, if you ah, thought about the kinds of consequences that make something wrong, and you were saying that um, it’s wrong depending on how it affects others.
R:Ah, or yourself, too, right.
I:Or yourself, okay.
R:Both.
I:So, in terms of your kind of health and well being?  Or, mm, kind of your psychological, mental health, or?
R:Um, probably a mixture of both.
I:Okay, so kind of thinking about consequences, um, of health and well being, at all different levels.  Okay, and um, what do you think, are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Not necessarily.  I mean, I hate to be sort of you know, teenage, it’s all relative type of thing, but I can’t think of anything, any specific action that would always be wrong, I guess.  I mean, I probably could if I thought about it.
I:Nothing immediately, or things that you always have in your head as this is wrong, you know, no matter what, no matter the context or anything.
R:Um, I don’t know, it’s fine to say.
I:Uh-huh, right.  And um, where would you say you’ve acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Um, probably parents and teachers and family.
I:And they explicitly tell you things or you sort of pick them up?
R:Well I think I, um, well, I can’t specifically remember going through a list of, no, this is wrong, or this is right.
I:
R:Um, but I think generally seeing how they conduct themselves and you learn by example.","Um.  I think a lot of it is just common sense.  I don’t know.

How do you normally decide, or know, what is good or bad, right or wrong in life?
R:I’d, I’d say I have an inner sense about it that is not really based on specific moral system or religious values, but just my general sense of how people should treat each other, and, let me think, I don’t know, I think it’s hard to pin down.
I:Do you feel like it’s hard to decide between right and wrong?
R:I feel like in a lot of situations there are a lot of factors to be considered, and that, um, that, from different perspectives right and wrong may have different meanings.
I:Do you feel like it’s gotten harder in the last two years to decide?
R:Um, in the last two years…I think, well, I think it just becomes harder  well, maybe not necessarily harder, but the more nuanced in general the more experience you have with the world and the more exposure you have to different ideas and to different ways of thinking about things.
I:Would you say your views have changed at all about right and wrong in the last 2 or 3 years?
R:Um, only, only that understanding that I just mentioned.  That, that it is fairly complex and difficult issue.
I:What do you think it is that actually makes something right or wrong?
R:I’m not sure that right or wrong is necessarily an attribute that anything has inherently.  I think it’s more your own perception of that.
I:Where would you say your views on morality come from?
R:Probably, probably my parents.  But no in the sort of directed, instructional sense of “don’t do this, this is wrong,” but rather, you know, the cues that I’ve picked up from the way they do things, and the way they think about situations.","I’d, I’d say I have an inner sense about it that is not really based on specific moral system or religious values, but just my general sense of how people should treat each other, and, let me think, I don’t know, I think it’s hard to pin down.

What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Something right would be, in a general type of case, something right would be something that is something with a favorable outcome, that benefits you or people pertaining to it.  People that could be affected by it. Something wrong would be the opposite, something that is negative to someone or a group of people or a time or anything.
I:Why is it wrong?
R:Because it, it’s, it’s, in my eyes it’s wrong because you’re taking away your life before you know what’s gonna happen.  You don’t know what’s gonna happen.  You don’t know how things are gonna clear up, you don’t know.
I:What if you’re terminally ill and you know what’s gonna happen?
R:No one knows.  No one knows.  There’s been so many different cases where people have been terminally ill and—my aunt that I lived with.

You know it’s still the law. I mean, the law is there for a reason.  I think that it goes the same way for rights and wrongs, you know. Yeah. Are there things that wrong…no laws against.  Um.  Well, there’s no law against ah, no law, well actually there is a law against suicide, but. Sort of.  Um, although I don’t know how they can enforce that, yeah.

Um, how do you decide or know what’s good and bad or right and wrong in life?
R:Um, probably, if it wasn’t really related to church, if I couldn’t get it thru religion then, it would depend probably on my girlfriend’s parents or my parents.
I:So, you’d talk to people?
R:I’d talk with somebody.  Or, or unless it was not an extreme situation than I could probably just figure it out on my own.
I:So, you, the way you talked about that it made me, gave me the impression that you, uh, you normally wouldn’t  lean to your religion to know what is right and wrong, first?  Is that right?
R:Most of the time.
I:Um, any, well, sort of given what talked about:  so you have got your religion and you’ve got sort of family and friends and then yourself, in general do you think it’s easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?  In thinking about the way you would normally decide?
R:I would say probably pretty easy.  Um, in addition to religion, I do a lot of checks and balances.
I:What do you mean by that?
R:Weigh the costs and the prices of the situation.  And you know there’s, if I’ve got an issue, I think about what, alright, what are my choices first of all, lay those choices out.  Now try and find every possible scenario for each choice.  And once I have found all of those see which one is most favorable.
I:Ok.
R:Then do that.
I:Do you think that deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder in the past two years?
R:I don’t know if it’s gotten easier or hard but I know it’s more of a question that had to be asked more often.
I:What do you mean by that?
R:More, more, ah, freedom has been given to me and I don’t have someone else there to make those decisions for me.
I:Ok.
R:I just get that question a lot more than I would if I was completely sheltered some where else.
I:It’s up to you to make the decisions more often now?
R:Yeah.
I:Ok.  But, we’ll probably get back to something.  If you think of something please tell me.  Um, so, what do you think that it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Makes it right or wrong?
I:Um hum.
R:Probably the, weighing out the costs.  If it’s right the costs are going to benefit everybody.  They’re going to be a positive effect.  If it’s wrong it’s probably going to have a negative effect on, maybe not you at the time, but somebody.  A positive, ah, doing something right is pretty much going to effect everyone positively.  If it’s something that’s wrong it seems most of the time that it would definitely affect at least one person negatively in every situation.
I:So, what kind of consequences, some sort of costs, would make something wrong?
R:Ah, any type of wrongdoing, we can’t use that word, but, um, it’s pretty much the first word that comes to my head, is using the same word, wrongdoing, it’s what, um, morals have taught you over the years of what, I mean, it’s more what’s been instilled in you that would give a basis.
I:Um hum.  Well, when you say that they, sort of the costs or the consequences of something, or, or, or, are like that bad costs or consequences, what, what kinds of things are bad consequences, like, what are the consequences that make something wrong?  What would it take, what would be an example of some of the consequences that would make something wrong?
R:Ah, any type of death or injury or hurting someone in, in, you know, an emotional way.
I:Um, are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves?
R:Anything that has to do with death or injury.
I:Ok.  Um, so what, what makes that wrong, what makes it wrong killing people or hurting people?
R:For me, my religion.
I:Your religion?
R:Um hum.
I:Um, ok.  Can you tell me a little bit, a little bit more about that?  In terms of like what it is about your religion that, like would….
R:It’s, it’s, it’s, it’s taking a life from someone else.  You can’t do that.  It’s just how I have been, you know, its how I have been taught since beginning, as long as I can remember.
I:Ok. Um, so where do you think you have gotten these moral views from?
R:Probably from growing up, having my parents teach them to me and church and from different friends.  You know, seeing what friends have done and how their actions have had reactions.
I:Do you have a sense of what the sort of, most, if there is one, are these sources sort of equal, do you feel like, one, one or more of them are sort of more fundamental to having, to your, how you know what’s right and wrong, do you feel like they sort of evolve?

R:My Mom and my sister.  Once in a while I have my own, like from out of nowhere, I would have, my Mom would think like where did you get these things, from your Dad, from your Mom, who did you get these examples from, where did you learn to be stubborn, where did you learn to be so prude , when did, where did you learn to talk back. I’m like did it all myself, but she won’t believe me, it’s just things like that, like certain things she’s wrong, like how to be stubborn, I learned from my Mom and my sister and my Dad, but my Mom ignores that as, it’s not true, it’s not true, your Dad’s the stubborn one.  And then, my Mom would say, you’re like a, you’re like a Martinez.  My Dad’s side and my Dad will be like you’re like a Gomez.  It’s kind of weird, like at my Dad’s house I act like my Mom, I fight with my Dad like, like little tiny arguments, not fight- fight but just like trying to see each other’s point of view.  Trying to like see like, it’s like almost kind of like a contest, like, like, I’m like no, it’s this and this and this thing, he’s like no that’s not, it’s true, it’s this and this and this until we actually find a way.  And he’s like and then once in a while he goes ay, you’re like a Gomez and I’m like that’s what Mom says, except Mom says I’m like a Martinez.  So.
I:So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I really don’t know.  Right or wrong is what you learn.  Most likely, because nobody would know what right or wrong is until they learned it. When they’re little.  That you grabbed something you’re not supposed, like eat candy before dinner, they’ll be going no, bad!  No!  And that’s where you learned wrong from right.  From your parents.
I:But you said that, something like killing is always wrong.
R:Yes.
I:So what is it about killing that makes it wrong?
R:You’re taking another person’s life away.  They cannot, for all you know, for all they know, something can be important in their life, family, friends, maybe they’re gonna make something good of themselves.  But they’re taken away their life, so they really can’t have no, they have, they don’t have, how do you say, um, a chance to do what they need to do.  They don’t have a chance to go back or anything.
I:How about littering, do you think that’s wrong, like if I had a coke but I just through it out, on the grass, would that be wrong?
R:Yes.
I:Is that, or is that wrong for everyone?
R:Yes, it is, I think it is, cause I always learned that way.  Because in a way you’re actually helping supposedly the devil take over us.
I:Oh really?
R:Yeah because he is the one that tempts us to do wrong things like murder someone, throw things on the floor, calling out people, things like that, like calling people names.  Yelling, stealing, things like that.
I:So how do you decide or know what is good and bad, or right and wrong?  You talked about, you, you look at the pros and cons, is there anything else you do?  When you’re trying to decide what’s good and bad, right and wrong?
R:Um, I look to where I learned, my, where I learned wrongs and rights. And then if that can’t help me, most likely I just, I look at everybody else, cause they’re doing the same thing and they see, and I feel like they’re doing something wrong, then I know it’s wrong.  Like, like people say when you’re looking someone else and you see they’re doing something wrong and then you notice that you’re either doing the same thing, you know it’s wrong.  If you feel that way, the same way when they’re doing it, then you have to feel the same way when you’re doing it.
I:Can you give me an example of some time when you were trying to decide, um, you know what’s wrong or right, good and bad?
R:Um, fights.  I think because you see someone fighting they’re like, how stupid can they be?  They’re just ruining themselves.  They can’t even be, they can’t be more mature, try to help themselves they just instead they wanna hurt someone just to see them, see right to like they feel, like sometimes I feel that they feel that like oh, it’s just that I, if I fight, they’ll understand me, if I fight they, nobody will do any, nobody will try to hurt me, when it’s not true because once you start fighting, they know how you fight, they learn you, and then they start jumping on you; everybody starts to hate you, their friends will start to hate you, things like that. was talking, someone (interviewer?) was rooting around in a bag or something and rustling through things which made it hard to understand some things/was distracting]","My Mom and my sister.

I’m like did it all myself, but she won’t believe me, it’s just things like that, like certain things she’s wrong, like how to be stubborn, I learned from my Mom and my sister and my Dad, but my Mom ignores that as, it’s not true, it’s not true, your Dad’s the stubborn one.  And then, my Mom would say, you’re like a, you’re like a Martinez.  My Dad’s side and my Dad will be like you’re like a Gomez.  It’s kind of weird, like at my Dad’s house I act like my Mom, I fight with my Dad like, like little tiny arguments, not fight- fight but just like trying to see each other’s point of view.  Trying to like see like, it’s like almost kind of like a contest, like, like, I’m like no, it’s this and this and this thing, he’s like no that’s not, it’s true, it’s this and this and this until we actually find a way.  And he’s like and then once in a while he goes ay, you’re like a Gomez and I’m like that’s what Mom says, except Mom says I’m like a Martinez.  So. I really don’t know.  Right or wrong is what you learn.  Most likely, because nobody would know what right or wrong is until they learned it. When they’re little.  That you grabbed something you’re not supposed, like eat candy before dinner, they’ll be going no, bad!  No!  And that’s where you learned wrong from right.  From your parents. Yes. You’re taking another person’s life away.  They cannot, for all you know, for all they know, something can be important in their life, family, friends, maybe they’re gonna make something good of themselves.  But they’re taken away their life, so they really can’t have no, they have, they don’t have, how do you say, um, a chance to do what they need to do.  They don’t have a chance to go back or anything. Yes. Yes, it is, I think it is, cause I always learned that way.  Because in a way you’re actually helping supposedly the devil take over us. Yeah because he is the one that tempts us to do wrong things like murder someone, throw things on the floor, calling out people, things like that, like calling people names.  Yelling, stealing, things like that. Um, I look to where I learned, my, where I learned wrongs and rights. And then if that can’t help me, most likely I just, I look at everybody else, cause they’re doing the same thing and they see, and I feel like they’re doing something wrong, then I know it’s wrong.  Like, like people say when you’re looking someone else and you see they’re doing something wrong and then you notice that you’re either doing the same thing, you know it’s wrong.  If you feel that way, the same way when they’re doing it, then you have to feel the same way when you’re doing it. Um, fights.  I think because you see someone fighting they’re like, how stupid can they be?  They’re just ruining themselves.  They can’t even be, they can’t be more mature, try to help themselves they just instead they wanna hurt someone just to see them, see right to like they feel, like sometimes I feel that they feel that like oh, it’s just that I, if I fight, they’ll understand me, if I fight they, nobody will do any, nobody will try to hurt me, when it’s not true because once you start fighting, they know how you fight, they learn you, and then they start jumping on you; everybody starts to hate you, their friends will start to hate you, things like that. was talking, someone (interviewer?) was rooting around in a bag or something and rustling through things which made it hard to understand some things/was distracting]","The respondent often grapples with moral dilemmas, relying on a mix of pros and cons analysis, personal experiences, and guidance from their mother and sister to navigate decisions, while also expressing concerns about social pressures from friends and a desire to avoid losing their relationships.",,,,"I:How do you normally decide or know what is good or bad or right and wrong in life?
R:Usually I don’t.  I go with what, one, my religion says.  Two, what I feel is right and three, what is socially accepted in the world and the environment around me to figure out what can be considered in the wrong area and the right area because a lot of things you don’t exactly know, so you have to ask around and that, asking around, is more in the area of your environment for that to be in the third category.  If my religion doesn’t say anything about it and in my personal beliefs I do not know yet, I can ask the people around me what is socially correct to them and from there I can make a decision what I feel from that answer, what I feel is right.  So I think it comes with three things, my religion, my morals and my social interaction with others that help me figure out what I think can be wrong and what I think can be right.
I:And is that sort of formula, religion, others and culture, did that change over the last three years or is that something you just developed more recently or is that something you’ve had for a while?
R:I think I developed it gradually growing out because before I never thought about religion, I thought about myself and then growing up I thought about religion and myself and I noticed during the times where I thought about myself when I was unsure of myself, I would ask my friends so it gradually incorporated all each other in together.  So growing up I started learning to realize what I use to determine things, how I am, my personality wise and I started to realize it growing up and started utilizing it with anything that I did.
I:Tell me what you think it is that actually makes something right or wrong?  What is it in the thing itself that you think makes it right or wrong and even though you have to go through this in different steps?
R:Generally a lot of people probably think it’s right or wrong is the rules that it’s socially set up.  Like the government set up rules buy I think what also helps the government is everyone’s own beliefs and religion because every person who has a right or wrong, people who don’t believe in God or hell, their right or wrong is very general and they have trouble determining what’s right or wrong and so instead of saying it’s right or wrong they say they don’t care, they’re doing what they want because that’s what they feel is their right.  So with them I see it as they don’t see right or wrong, they just do what they want to do.  It’s do what you feel and have no regrets.  As for other people I see that they do the right or wrong; one, because they don’t want to get punished, like stealing from the store.  You will get fined or punished so that’s another thing of what’s right and then they also think of what their religion tells them or what their families taught them.  So I think that’s what the general right or wrong is.  It’s what socially tells you, like will you get punished for it?  Will you get fined?  Will you get hurt?  Will you get lectured by your parents?  And also the fact of will my parents be happy that I did this?  Will my mom who died away, would she be fine with this?  Is my religion saying this is okay?  Does my conscience say it’s okay?  Because your conscience is what your family built up for you, your conscience, like what’s right or wrong is what your family taught you what right or wrong is so that is your conscience.  So either way, it still relates to your family and what they taught you.
I:And you talked about consequences and you talked about, it sort of comes from religion or rules or whatever.  Are those sort of equal in your mind in terms of determining what’s right or wrong or is one more determinative than the other do you think?
R:I think they’re equal.  A lot of times they’re equal unless – occasionally one that’s usually more stronger than your religion would be rules because you don’t always think about your religion 24, seven.  You should as we are devoted – in my religion you should be thinking about doing the right thing and the wrong thing all the time.  It should be on your mind every minute of your life, but it usually isn’t because you have things at school, work, friends, family, emotional problems, home problems, that you don’t always think about it; and so I think what is higher than your religion would be rules, the consequences from the rules that is socially set.","Usually I don’t.

Where do your own views of right and wrong come from?
R:Um, mostly the Bible and like my personal like individual views, I uh, I try to stay away from anything that like, like putting stuff into my body or whatever, drugs or alcohol, stuff like that, to make me feel better, or that numb the pain or do that, I try to avoid that.  And part of that is because of my dad and him like being an alcoholic and running from stuff.  I try like to never run from stuff.  Like even with little stuff, like I don’t even drink coffee, cause I’d rather, you know, try to, like, go through myself, you know, or, that’s another thing too, if I’m really tired sometimes then I wouldn’t need that much coffee cause I haven’t build up like that.
I:Yeah.
R:And so.  Yeah.
I:Cause your tolerance is way low for coffee.  Or caffeine I guess.
R:Yeah.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, how it affects you and how it affects the people around you.  Um, I think that, the concept of sin, or the mainstream is like the thing that God says you can’t just do.  There’s no, you know, there’s no real logic, you can’t just do it.  But the thing is sin is anything that you’re, you’re doing that is hurting yourself in the long run or hurting yourself you know, like that’s the basis for morality, in my view anyways.
I:Why do you think it’s wrong to hurt you or to hurt somebody else?
R:Because, this is a hard question.  Um,
I:I’m not trying to talk you out of anything,
R:Yeah.
I:I just want to sort of see what’s behind what you’re saying.
R:Yeah.  (pause)  That’s a good one.
I:Well I mean for example if uh, if uh, and I think we have some questions about lying and stuff like that, but if you lie or cheat on a test, that’s not really going to hurt anybody else or it’s not going to hurt you is it?  Is that okay to do or why is that not okay to do?  Would it hurt somebody else?
R:Um, (pause) I don’t know.  I guess uh, you could say it would hurt you in the long run because you’re, you’re doing something that you’re taking the easy way out and you’re not really learning the stuff you know, that’s kind of like a lame reason not to do it.  Cause if you do it you’ll get an A or an F, you know, or I could pass this class because I cheated you know.  But it’s one of those like flimsy things, I guess.  But you don’t, you don’t hurt yourself or other people because that’s not logical, you’re trying to survive, you’re trying to advance yourself, and like you know, stupid Darwinism, or like survival of the fittest, you’re still like, you’re like an animal, you’re trying to survive.  And if you’re hurting other people you’re hurting yourself and you’re hurting humanity, and you’re hurting your chance of survival I guess.
I:And when you make those decisions based on whether you are or not going to hurt somebody or yourself, how do you know the consequences are going to be bad or wrong down the road?
R:Um, well ultimately you don’t really.  Like with some stuff you won’t know.  You just like, you know, like your best guess, like is it a good idea for me to cheat, to cheat on the test?  Well, it probably won’t hurt me but it could, and you, you just say, well, you just kind of go from there I guess.  I don’t know if that answers your question.
I:Well do you have any specific examples of an instance where you had to make a decision recently?
R:Um,
I:Relatively recently, it doesn’t have to be in the last few days or weeks or anything?
R:(pause) I don’t know.  Well stuff has been pretty much black and white. I don’t really run across that very much so.
I:So give me a black and white one.
R:Like,
I:Like when you said this is wrong and this is right, why did you say that was wrong, or why did you know that was wrong?  Whatever it was?  Tell me that situation?
R:Um, (pause), I’m trying to think of a situation like, actually the truck one might be a good idea.  Cause um, I wanted to go back and get the license plate cause then I would look like I didn’t trust him, and I felt,
I:Tell me because this will be somebody that will be hearing this and they don’t know the back story, so just a little bit.
R:Oh, um,
I:That you got, somebody hit you?
R:Yeah, a guy hit my truck and I was like lame and I went over and got his phone number and it only like ended up like breaking my, um, like breaking my brake lamp, so I was like all right, it’s only like 60 bucks, no big deal, I’ll just get his phone number, and I’ll call him.  And then I was thinking well, should I get his license plate number?  Like, like you should, thinking with your brain you know, you should like back yourself up.  And then I started thinking about it and I was like well I’ll have to walk all the way over there and he’ll know that like, I obviously don’t trust him cause like the, the, I don’t know, I didn’t trust that he gave me the right phone number. So I was like, well I guess I won’t.  Yeah, and then I ended up being screwed over.

R:Um,  I think that’s a funny question, uh, the easy, well that’s not an easy answer, I think in general I identify with Christianity and especially like with Jesus and his story and I think a lot of like what he does is like motivated by loving people and loving God and like in a way where like you’re not just like letting people do whatever you want, you know, you want what’s best for them and so that’s generally I guess, trying to figure it out.
I:So in a sense looking out for other people and wanting what’s best for other people?
R:Yeah.
I:So that’s how you know what’s good or bad or right or wrong?
R:Yeah, like—
I:Sort of like that’s the measure?
R:That’s what I try to do and like that’s very, you know in one way where that’s really I guess like evident but the  some of my friends is like for me like, well my dad was like an alcoholic and died when I was pretty young so like alcohol is pretty significant for me so like generally like I’d be like pretty standoffish with it even though like a lot of my friends aren’t and it’s not, and so like you know like and I think like in terms of like biblically, like I think it’s completely fine to drink.  I don’t think that there’s any problem with that, it’s just that like my individual experience is also like defining what that looks like.
I:So you have, but you do have this kind of, you said biblically it’s okay, so you, there’s an external—that you would look to, but since you think it’s okay there, it’s more of a I don’t want to have anything to do with it because of what my personal experience has been and stuff like that?
R:Yeah, yeah, and I think in general like yeah there’s trying to like love people, love myself, love God, is like the more external guiding thing.
I:Would you say that in general it’s very easy or very hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Um, I think generally it’s pretty easy.  Yeah, in general.
I:Would you say that that’s gotten easier in the last few years or it’s about the same, or?
R:Uh, I think it’s, it’s about the same.  I think one of our, kind of my first few years of college I was more, things were more black and white, you know, and like as time has gone on it doesn’t feel quite as black and white, um, but—
I:So does that make it harder to figure out what’s—
R:Harder.
I:The right or wrong thing to do in any given situation?
R:I think so.
I:What is it that you think makes something right or wrong?  What is it that is either, makes it—yeah.
R:Um, I think , Yeah, so I’d like to say that like loving yourself, loving people, loving God position, but then it’s like well if there’s a decision where you think that you’re loving someone and you’re not, is that still the right decision anyways, you know?  I don’t really know, so I guess I’d say like yeah, trying to do things out of love but with a, like the little asterisk saying that might be more complicated than I realize.  You know what I mean?
I:Do you think that that notion, your idea of doing things out of love is related to consequences or is it related to some sort of, you know something, I'm not sure I want to say it this way, but I will, it’s like a rule or a law about love or something like that or is it something else sort of transcends or goes away from any of that sort of stuff?
R:So I think in general I'm not very concerned with like right and wrong, like that’s not really the paradigm that I tend to think about and um, and so like that idea of doing things like out of love I think more has to do with so my  is like that’s how we were like created to be, you know?  and so yeah, it’s not, it’s not the like you’re doing things because you don’t want to like go to hell or you don’t want to like you know give back some way or have karma like do something.  It’s just that like living as we were created to.  Like being a full human being, having a full human experience, like being able to identify with humanity and to like see people as people.  You know what I mean?  Because when you don’t, when you can't see people as people like they suffer because you know you do asshole things but like you suffer because you like aren’t recognizing that, you know what I mean?  So.
I:So and then back to what you were saying before about with the asterisk and that difficulty is to how to figure out what actually demonstrates actual love toward the person in the sort of decision?
R:Yeah, and most of the time I think we have no clue like what that is, like especially in terms of something cross-cultural or coming into a new situation or especially like as Christians, walking in and saying well we’re going to do this or we’re going to do that and a lot of times that’s totally messed up and you’ll find doing something that’s really offensive or totally obscures like who Jesus is, you know that, if you do what you do.
I:Where do you think your moral views come from?
R:Uh, I would think that they come from the Bible.  You know?  I hope.  I may not, but I think so.
I:And trying to put that into practice in some way?
R:Yeah, I think just, yes, thinking I would figure it out and then going back and being like wait but this part doesn’t make sense and then, you know, so it’s like, just continue like changing things, so I'm sure like if we ever meet again I’ll think something different, you know, but.
I:Yeah, but that’s, so that’s more of—
R:Just a process—
I:Yeah, like essentially a process throughout your life.
R:Yeah.","Um,  I think that’s a funny question, uh, the easy, well that’s not an easy answer, I think in general I identify with Christianity and especially like with Jesus and his story and I think a lot of like what he does is like motivated by loving people and loving God and like in a way where like you’re not just like letting people do whatever you want, you know, you want what’s best for them and so that’s generally I guess, trying to figure it out. Yeah. Yeah, like— That’s what I try to do and like that’s very, you know in one way where that’s really I guess like evident but the  some of my friends is like for me like, well my dad was like an alcoholic and died when I was pretty young so like alcohol is pretty significant for me so like generally like I’d be like pretty standoffish with it even though like a lot of my friends aren’t and it’s not, and so like you know like and I think like in terms of like biblically, like I think it’s completely fine to drink.  I don’t think that there’s any problem with that, it’s just that like my individual experience is also like defining what that looks like. Yeah, yeah, and I think in general like yeah there’s trying to like love people, love myself, love God, is like the more external guiding thing. Um, I think generally it’s pretty easy.  Yeah, in general. Uh, I think it’s, it’s about the same.  I think one of our, kind of my first few years of college I was more, things were more black and white, you know, and like as time has gone on it doesn’t feel quite as black and white, um, but— Harder. I think so.  Um, I think , Yeah, so I’d like to say that like loving yourself, loving people, loving God position, but then it’s like well if there’s a decision where you think that you’re loving someone and you’re not, is that still the right decision anyways, you know?  I don’t really know, so I guess I’d say like yeah, trying to do things out of love but with a, like the little asterisk saying that might be more complicated than I realize.  You know what I mean? So I think in general I'm not very concerned with like right and wrong, like that’s not really the paradigm that I tend to think about and um, and so like that idea of doing things like out of love I think more has to do with so my  is like that’s how we were like created to be, you know?  and so yeah, it’s not, it’s not the like you’re doing things because you don’t want to like go to hell or you don’t want to like you know give back some way or have karma like do something.  It’s just that like living as we were created to.  Like being a full human being, having a full human experience, like being able to identify with humanity and to like see people as people.  You know what I mean?  Because when you don’t, when you can't see people as people like they suffer because you know you do asshole things but like you suffer because you like aren’t recognizing that, you know what I mean?  So. Yeah, and most of the time I think we have no clue like what that is, like especially in terms of something cross-cultural or coming into a new situation or especially like as Christians, walking in and saying well we’re going to do this or we’re going to do that and a lot of times that’s totally messed up and you’ll find doing something that’s really offensive or totally obscures like who Jesus is, you know that, if you do what you do.  Uh, I would think that they come from the Bible.  You know?  I hope.  I may not, but I think so. Yeah, I think just, yes, thinking I would figure it out and then going back and being like wait but this part doesn’t make sense and then, you know, so it’s like, just continue like changing things, so I'm sure like if we ever meet again I’ll think something different, you know, but. Just a process— Yeah.","The respondent primarily relies on their Christian faith and the teachings of Jesus to determine right and wrong, influenced by personal experiences with alcohol in their family, while also acknowledging the complexity of moral decisions and the importance of love in guiding their actions."

R:It’s hard to decide.
I:And do you think that deciding has gotten easier or harder over the last couple years?
R:Easier.
I:How so?
R:Now that I’m a mom, it’s a lot different.
I:And what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Mmm.
I:When you are making a decision, do you think about the consequences, or do you get a feeling of what’s right or wrong, or do you base it on laws?
R:I get a feeling.
I:What’s the feeling like?
R:It’s like a stomach feeling.  I just get a gut feeling, and just.
I:You just know?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  So, from where have you acquired your moral views?

I:Do you feel like that’s something you were taught, or something you thought of on your own?

R:I guess I always do what my, I just follow what my parents told me you know, what was good and bad when I was younger, I still do that today.
I:You follow what they tell you.
R:What they told me.
I:They told you.
R:You know like, don’t drink, don’t do drugs, stay in school you know, stuff like that.  I still listen to them.  Plus alcohol is really gross tasting to me.

R:Easy.
I:Why is that?
R:Um, I don’t know.  Its’ just always –
I:Do you have a fierce sense of what’s right and wrong?
R:Yeah.  I just, whenever something even slightly wrong happens, I get in a whole and I just start feeling really awkward and weird and I want to stop it.
I:Slightly wrong happens, meaning you do something wrong or some body else does something wrong.
R:Uh, like uh if I’m going, if I’m driving down the road and the speed limit is like forty and I see I’m going like forty-four, its like, I like hit my brakes you know, stuff like that.  I mean, I know it isn’t like really something wrong but --
I:Interesting.
R:You know, I’m really, I play by the rules,
I:Let me make an observation.
R:Okay.
I:Two years ago you struck me as a little bit less like that and a little bit more sarcastic and does that, would that be accurate or not?
R:I’m still like that, I’m just, I don’t know, it’s kind of, I’m not sure why I’m not like, always like that.  I’m just not like that right now I guess, I don’t know why.
I:It’s alright, that’s fine.  I think I uh, well I’ll leave it at that.
R:But yeah, I mean, I’m still the same person, it’s just uh, I guess I don’ know, my mom was out there before, I guess it made me feel more comfortable and uh, I don’t know.  Don’t mean that as any offense or anything, it’s just kind of weird I guess a little bit.
I:Um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:(long pause)
I:Is it rules, is it laws? Is it the consequences of something?
R:That’s a tough question.
I:Is it how it feels?  Is it what God says?  Is it something else?
R:All of the above.  Uh, jees I don’t know.
I:Well, I’m gonna hazard a guess then, rules aren’t necessarily what makes something right and wrong.
R:That is correct because there can be –
I:You do break the rules it sounds like as long as somebody tells you it’s okay.
R:Yeah.
I:So what makes something right or wrong?
R:Uh, (long pause), if something, if you do something and I don’t know, like if you do something and it doesn’t like hurt anyone, then I guess it’s okay, gol that’s a really stupid thing.
I:Now uh, you break the speed limit and it might not hurt anyone, you go more than five miles over and you stop and get slower but it doesn’t hurt anyone to go ten miles and hour over.
R:Then I guess that’s one of the rule ones then, uh, oh jees.
I:Take your time.
R:Um, I guess you have to give me an example and I’d tell you why it’s wrong or right or something.
I:Okay, so is drinking alcohol wrong because it tastes bad, wrong because it’s against the rules, wrong because it can cause harm to somebody else.  What if you’re just popping a beer at home, you’re not gonna get drunk, nobody will know, you’re not gonna drive.
R:I think that’s perfectly fine.
I:It’s perfectly fine.
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, you just don’t.
R:I just don’t because it tastes like crap except for saki.
I:So obviously the rules, that it’s against the law to do that drinking, --
R:Which I think is also really stupid because you know, you can go and get killed but you can’t have a beer.  But that’s a completely different story.
I:So, it’s not the rules or laws necessarily, maybe sometimes it might be.
R:I guess it’s moral judgment too.
I:Moral judgment, what do you mean by that?
R:I knew that was coming.  Uh, I don’t know, like if you think about something and you think it’s okay then, oh that’s really bad because some people think really bad stuff is okay but uh, like average joe, what he thinks is right and wrong, I think you know, would probably be okay.
I:So generally speaking, you can trust the moral judgment of the people around us.
R:I think so for the most part.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Well, obviously like extreme stuff, like rape, I think that should have the death penalty but uh.
I:Why?
R:It’s just, oh it’s just, I think its worse than murder.
I:Why?
R:I just think it’s just horrible, I don’t know.  It’s just –
I:Where’d you come up with that?
R:Ever since I found out what that meant, you know, like along time ago, I just thought it was like the worst thing ever.
I:Why?
R:It’s just, I don’t know why, it’s just wrong.  I –
I:Some people would say, well it didn’t kill the person, is what they would say to that.
R:Oh, well like, but for the most part, it like ruins it, like if they’re dead, obviously it like ruins your life, you don’t have to live with it but if you’re raped you have to live with the indignity you know, the rest of your life and the memory, it just haunts you.
I:What if you never told anybody?
R:It’d still effect you.
I:True.  Besides rape and murder, any actions that are always wrong in themselves?
R:Not stealing because sometimes you have to steal like, well not now a days, but like, I’m not talking about myself but, like uh, like starving family you know, there’s a loaf of bread, go steal a loaf of bread to feed their little kids.
I:These people in New Orleans, they’re looting, but there is no law, no order, nobody stopping them.
R:Are they actually looting there?
I:Is that wrong?
R:Well, that’s a tough one because uh, for the most part it is but, I don’t know, like the stuff, where the stuff is just gonna get ruined, well, yeah, I think it’s wrong, but if the stuff is gonna get ruined, I can see why they do it though, but that’s probably not what they’re thinking.  So, yeah, I think it’s wrong.
I:Why is it wrong?
R:Because it’s not theirs.  They didn’t pay for it where they could if the really wanted, they could have gotten it.
I:But you just told me that if you’re really hungry, it sounds like stealing food was okay.
R:Yeah, but, that’s like in, that’s a need, not a want.  Like, you might want a T.V. you don’t need a T.V.  You need food.
I:Okay.
R:Because I assume you’re talking about like looting like electronics and stuff like that, you’re not talking about like stealing like –
I:Some guy stole a bunch of shirts, why would you do that?
R:Oh, my gosh, a bunch of shirts?

I – Oh, well like, but for the most part, it like ruins it, like if they’re dead, obviously it like ruins your life, you don’t have to live with it but if you’re raped you have to live with the indignity you know, the rest of your life and the memory, it just haunts you. It’d still effect you. Not stealing because sometimes you have to steal like, well not now a days, but like, I’m not talking about myself but, like uh, like starving family you know, there’s a loaf of bread, go steal a loaf of bread to feed their little kids. Are they actually looting there? Well, that’s a tough one because uh, for the most part it is but, I don’t know, like the stuff, where the stuff is just gonna get ruined, well, yeah, I think it’s wrong, but if the stuff is gonna get ruined, I can see why they do it though, but that’s probably not what they’re thinking.  So, yeah, I think it’s wrong. Because it’s not theirs.  They didn’t pay for it where they could if the really wanted, they could have gotten it. Yeah, but, that’s like in, that’s a need, not a want.  Like, you might want a T.V. you don’t need a T.V.  You need food. Because I assume you’re talking about like looting like electronics and stuff like that, you’re not talking about like stealing like – Oh, my gosh, a bunch of shirts?  I guess my parents mainly.","The respondent plans to use an inheritance of $100,000 primarily to buy a car and pay for education, influenced by the necessity of transportation and the importance of a degree for job prospects, while also expressing a desire for parental support and a fear of the unknown in college life, alongside a strong moral compass shaped by their parents' teachings against drinking and drugs.","I:How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I don’t know. I just know if it is good or not.  I have always been taught that stealing is wrong and stuff like that. I just know I guess.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Easy.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Pretty much the same.
I:Why?
R:It has really changed. Right or wrong has really changed in 3 years. I guess I’ve matured more, but I still know what is right and wrong.
I:Have your moral views changed in the past 2 years?
R:What do you mean by moral views?
I:Like how view what is morally right or wrong?
R:That is pretty much the same.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Something that doesn’t hurt anyone and good things come if it is the right thing to do.  If you hurt someone or something bad happens because it is wrong to do.
I:What kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:If it negatively affects someone I mean it is a bad thing.  I can’t really think of something to describe that.
I:So if it doesn’t negatively affect someone to you it is not wrong?
R:I don’t know I need an example.  There are some things that don’t negatively affect people, but are still wrong so I don’t know.  It’s kind of a difficult question.
I:So if someone steals something, but it doesn’t really affect the company because they have insurance and maybe it didn’t hurt anyone-no one was there and no one saw it and they really needed it for their family, then what?
R:Well then, if they really needed it for their family and it doesn’t hurt anyone.  It is wrong, but I mean -what are they stealing? In your example what are they stealing?
I:Well, do you see different things as different?
R:Yeah, it is obviously wrong stealing is wrong, but it isn’t affecting them.
I:So what if they were stealing medical supplies?
R:Yeah, that is OK.
I:What if they are stealing money?
R:For what?
I:Just to provide for their family.  Their family is poor and they don’t have any money.
R:That’s a tough one. It is wrong.  I don’t know. That’s a tough question.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:I don’t know.  Maybe my parents a little bit, but honestly I don’t know.","I don’t know. I just know if it is good or not.  I have always been taught that stealing is wrong and stuff like that.

R:I go with my gut feeling, I go with my heart.  Like my heart tells me a lot of things.  Like, I can tell if something is wrong, because my heart will start pounding real fast and I can tell that something’s not right.  And then if I know it’s good, I would be very calm, like okay, totally different person, but if I know something is wrong, I’m very iffy about it and my, I start really thinking different, so that’s how I make decisions.
I:So it’s like an internal thing that you have.  Okay.  And where do you think that came from for you?  Like where do you think the ability to know those things?
R:I have no clue.  I think the only person that would know that is God himself.
I:Do you remember always being that way?  Being able to tell like that, what was right or wrong?
R:Yeah.  Younger, when I was younger, I used to feel that way.  When I know I did something wrong.  I would just be thinking like, oh, I know I was wrong, I know I’m getting a butt whipping and sure enough I’d get a butt whipping, so.  I would know it just from that   inner instinct.
I:So, for you then, do you think it gets easier or harder to make those decisions about right and wrong as you get older?
R:I think it pretty much gets a little bit harder just because it’s not about just me anymore, I have someone younger than me, so it gets harder because not only do I have to think for myself, I have to think for my family and I have to think for my daughter.  So, it’s kinda, it gets difficult.
I:And what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Like what is it that actually makes something a right or a wrong thing.
R:I’m not too sure.
I:Like do you think it’s more external things like the consequences, how the person feels about it?
R:I think it’s consequences.
I:Okay, like what will happen if you do it?
R:Yeah, if you do this, you will get a butt whooping.  That’s how I look at it with my daughter.  I set her down and I say if you touch Mommy’s, if you touch Mommy’s computer, you will see this belt hit your booty, so she thinks about it and she try to do something else, so I think it’s consequences that really makes it.
I:Makes it right or wrong.
R:Yep.","I go with my gut feeling, I go with my heart.  Like my heart tells me a lot of things.

R:What do you mean what makes something right or wrong?
I:Why is doing one thing right verses doing another thing wrong?
R:I mean it depends on what kind of situation you’re in.  It really does. Like, like, the situation is like, say my friends is going out to go partying and do drugs or whatever, um, it would be up to me to tag along.  But in reality I know in the back of my head, I know what is right.  To let them go and stop hanging out with that crowd.
I:Where do your own views of right and wrong come from?
R:From my upbringing.
I:From the way your mom raised you?
R:Yeah, the way she raised me.  So it depends on how you were raised, if you were raised, I mean you ain’t got to live in no suburban area to know what’s right or wrong to know what to do in life.  To be successful in life or whatever.  If you were raised right, then you were just raised right.  I mean there’s rich people that’s got problems.  Everybody’s got problems.  There’s kids at school killing up their classmates and teachers, I mean it depends on what your upbringing was.
I:And maybe you could just tell me a little bit what you mean by raised right?  I mean I think I know what you mean, I just want you to explain it a little bit more.
R:Uh, basically, um, like my mom, get home from school, get off your school clothes, get that books out, get ready for dinner, I mean, that type of stuff, don’t let them hang out, run the streets, do what they want to do, that type of stuff.  I mean you have to have like um, rules and regulations. Every parent should have their rules and regulations, and if you don’t buy, you don’t live by those rules and regulations, it will just lead you to the wrong way.
I:Do you think that everybody should have the same sorts of rules and regulations?  Like your mom should have the same as somebody else?
R:I don’t  think that cause everybody has different beliefs, and they’re all, like I said, everybody has different beliefs, some parents don’t believe in what my mom believes in.  Like the hanging out and that’s one of my mom’s main beliefs, get home, get out your school clothes, get ready to do your chores, do your homework, get ready for dinner, watch some TV, ready to start the day all over.  Everybody’s parent’s don’t do that.  Some people’s parents would rather just, I mean there’s two of hard working parents out there and they don’t have time to do that stuff, but somewhere in your life you have to find that time to be able to do that, if not, your child will end up like the trench coat mafia kid, or a rapist or a killer or in prison, and I mean it’s all about you upbringing, if you’re raised right then.  And I’m not going to say everybody goes down that road, cause I would be sitting here lying if I said, cause there’s people that were raised better than me, and still just messed up in the head, I mean why, I don’t know, but, you know, it’s just the way people are I guess.
I:Okay you mentioned several things there, the first one you said was something mafia kid?
R:Yeah.
I:Is that a local gang or?
R:No, remember in Colorado, they called themselves the trench coat mafia?
I:Oh the trench coat, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I forgot.
R:You know where they killed the teacher and the kid.
I:Yeah, I gotcha.
R:I mean so some of the kids. I  Yeah, so some of them formed their own little, Yeah.  I mean parents don’t look into that kind of stuff.  My mom does, about all, she, I don’t know, you have to work, and hard, and whatever, no matter what it is, know that you have children and the reality, your world revolves around them, your world revolves around them, no matter what because by the time you die, or my mom dies or whatever, or I die before her, she’s always going to remember, she’s going to have scholarships on the wall and she raised me right.  And after she raised me it’s up to me to choose the road I took.  But as long as she knows in the back of her head what she did for me was right and, I go that wrong road, that was my choice.  But like I mean, like the kids shooting up the schools, somewhere in there they don’t have no family dinners or something.  I mean there was something wrong, those kids were messed up in their heads, they shouldn’t go kill innocent people or, it’s just wrong.  They don’t take time with their kids.
I:In any given situation, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong?  Is it just based on what you’re saying how you’re raised up and stuff?
R:Basically I’ll sit down and think what would my mom tell me.  Sit down and think what she would say if I do this.  How would she feel about it.
I:Do you have any examples maybe, recently in your life?
R:No.  I mean I don’t do wrong, I live by my mom’s rules and regulations, I mean that’s the only way you’re going to live longer.  That’s what I said, some kids out there that really don’t, that have what I don’t’ have and still don’t’ care like I said, and still go mess up, and turned out to be transients and all kind of wild stuff.
I:Do you think in those cases those kids, because they’re, let’s say their parents let them do whatever and they, do you think those kids don’t know right from wrong?  Or do they know anyway?
R:They still know right from wrong but you know, um, oh hell my parents don’t care if I actually die.
I:Yeah.
R:That’s how I feel about it.","What do you mean what makes something right or wrong? I mean it depends on what kind of situation you’re in.  It really does.

I think, I think in your heart if you feel that this might hurt someone or might not do something good for you or if, if it isn’t, if it isn’t a good thing—I don’t know, I just think that you can, if you’re not too damaged by the world around you I think people can lose a sense of what’s right and wrong from they, are too like, when they just, like people who listen to screaming music, I think that it ruins their, their nerves and just their, any sense of, of like, I think if a person, like for example, if a person  there’s a, a girl a student with my, my teacher, and she listens to this I don’t know what they’re called but they, what they do is they scream you know and she’s, she’s a classical musician and after listening to so much screaming, she really has no sense of how to be musical, like she doesn’t, she doesn’t realize the importance of softs  and the beauty of silence and I don’t know.
I:Okay.  Um, how do you decide or know what is good and bad or right and wrong in life?
R:What’s in my heart, what I feel is true and what I’ve learned through my religion is, is right and what I think will benefit me for the best.  You know or give me a challenge, you know, I don’t, I don’t know, that’s I think, how.","Ah, my values, my religion.  Yeah, um, I really think, I just really believe what, I mean, what the, my religion believes.  In morals and I see why, I don’t know, some people they, they don’t see why and but I just really think I, I see why. What do I think it is that makes something right or wrong.  I think, I think in your heart if you feel that this might hurt someone or might not do something good for you or if, if it isn’t, if it isn’t a good thing—I don’t know, I just think that you can, if you’re not too damaged by the world around you I think people can lose a sense of what’s right and wrong from they, are too like, when they just, like people who listen to screaming music, I think that it ruins their, their nerves and just their, any sense of, of like, I think if a person, like for example, if a person  there’s a, a girl a student with my, my teacher, and she listens to this I don’t know what they’re called but they, what they do is they scream you know and she’s, she’s a classical musician and after listening to so much screaming, she really has no sense of how to be musical, like she doesn’t, she doesn’t realize the importance of softs  and the beauty of silence and I don’t know.

R:Um, by what I have been taught in my childhood.  By my parents, by my church, my our scriptures and the Book of Mormon and also by the spirit.  What I feel is right or wrong.  Sometimes it’s obvious.
I:Could you describe what you mean by what you feel is right or wrong?  Could you describe what you mean to me?
R:Well uh,
I:Which uh, some people would say if it feels good to me I’m going to do something, is that what you mean?
R:Yeah, uh,
I:Do you mean feel good in what way though?
R:Like I feel at peace.
I:Oh, okay.
R:Sometimes I have to pray to get that feeling, if it’s a really tough decision, tough question, I maybe fast, I pray, just so I could be humble enough and prayerful enough so that I could hear, I could tell what he would like me to do.  Sometimes I just have to go with it you know.
I:Okay.  Okay.
R:But yeah, it’s usually a peaceful feeling in my heart.
I:Okay.
R:Or I receive an answer through someone else, that yeah, that would be a right thing to do.  And a lot of time I’m assured by my decision in what happened after I decided to do that.  I’m like oh yes, I’m happy that I did that.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?  Or maybe stayed the same?
R:I think it’s maybe, I think it’s kind of the same.  The yes, the things that I’ve decided are a little more life changing, who I’m going to marry and things like that, so I think maybe it’s harder the more substantial choices, they might hurt you, but I think it’s kind of, since I’ve been following and keeping and doing the things that I think are right, I think it’s been easy for me to make those choices.  So.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Well what your opinion is on what is right and wrong, which can of course vary.  But then also I think the laws that are set in our nation and in our church, that helps me decide what’s right or wrong, if it’s hurting someone, I can know if it’s right or wrong, um, so yeah.
I:Okay.  So this feeling that you were talking about, does that help you in convince you in thinking that something is right or wrong, cause you said for you that varies from one person to the next.  Other people might not have that feeling I guess that you’re talking about, spiritual feelings.
R:Yeah.  I think so.  I think sometimes the Spirit is felt in many different ways.  But then I also feel that um, everyone can get, and receive guidance from the spirit.  I once heard someone give a talk from our church that said when he met the girl of his dreams, he wasn’t waiting for a yes, no.  He felt right to him, and said okay I’m going with this heavenly father, unless you stop me and think it’s not the right thing, so please do this.  So yeah, sometimes you don’t feel exactly if it’s right or it’s wrong.
I:Okay.
R:I think people can tend, everyone can feel it, just in their own way.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?  And if so, can you give me some examples.
R:I think having an affair, I think that’s always wrong.
I:What makes that wrong?
R:Because um, you are deceiving your family, you are switching your love to not your wife who you are married to and you’ve made covenants in the temple to be only with them, and not you’re breaking those covenants, it’s not being honest with your wife, it’s just very wrong to me.  It’s hurtful, it hurts others around you.  It’s not following the commandments, and the, I don’t see how that could ever be seen as a good thing or the best choice or the right thing to do that will help people.
I:Have you seen circumstances where that’s been difficult for families to deal with?
R:Yes.  My mom’s best friend, her husband cheated on her, and they divorced and he lived just with this girl that he had this affair with and now she had to go full time to work and couldn’t spend the time with her children.  Her son had a really hard time with it, and um, he questioned the church and he questioned many things because of the actions I believe because of the actions, although he has decided to be righteous in the end, it was a very tough decision for him.
I:So this man was a Latter Day Saint also?
R:Yes, he was a Latter Day Saint, they were married in the temple as well, although he was ex-communicated
I:Because of the affair or?
R:Because of the affair, yes.
I:Okay.  Can I ask you, if you don’t mind, if this isn’t too personal, when you see a situation like that does that challenge your faith or call into question the power of the temple or the covenants that you’ve talked about?
R:No, cause it’s not to do with the covenants, it’s to do with the people who are keeping covenants.  They weren’t keeping covenants, although she was, he wasn’t, it just makes me actually stronger in my faith, just to know that I need to be righteous cause I know this could happen to anyone.  They were good people they just strayed, he did.  Um, and so, it didn’t call into question my faith, it just made me want to follow even more.
I:You may have answered this, but I’ll ask this anyway, from where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Uh, well I was born into the church, and um, I went to church every Sunday, I went to Sunday school, my parents they taught me, it was my decision when I was 8 whether to be baptized in the church which I decided yes I would, but yes.","Um, by what I have been taught in my childhood.  By my parents, by my church, my our scriptures and the Book of Mormon and also by the spirit.  What I feel is right or wrong.  Sometimes it’s obvious. Well uh, Yeah, uh, Like I feel at peace.

How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:How I feel? I can usually get a sense for if it might not be the best thing, also going by what I've learned because I have a testimony in my church so I think they have great advices  my church says all those things and also praying and discussing with my husband.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It's pretty easy I think. I actually haven’t really had a hard time with that.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past couple of years?
R:I’d say it's just the same.
I:Really?
R:Yeah. I never had a hard time like or was never in an environment that was like, “Oh, you should have a drink of this,” or anything like that but…
I:And why not?
R:Because of I guess who I hung out with. I guess being in Utah, I don’t have to worry about it as much, although.
I:Although yeah. I've been in Utah for a week, there are a lot of people here.
R:Actually my middle school that they’re at, that I went to in my first year, it had the worst drug problem. Yeah, my middle school. I guess, I wasn’t attracted to people that might cause harm or were doing bad stuff and they weren’t attracted to me so it just didn’t happen.
I:So you’d say it's always been relatively easy for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Yeah. Well what I think is right and wrong.
I:Have your views of what was right and wrong changed at all over the past few years?
R:No. I say they become more defined, but like focused.
I:Yeah. What do you mean?
R:Like for instance, my church has always said, marry someone like a return missionary and someone who has your values. Which I always just thought that, “Yeah, return missionary, someone who’s a member of the church”, so that was the fuzzy focus, right? And when I met my husband before he was my husband, I realized how much more like he really did have the values that I had. There can be many people in the church that don’t have your same like values or what how they, what they want to do with their family and how they see, what their political views are. I was just amazed at how we’re really we're so much alike, and so that was more of a focused. So I think I'm more like more picky.
I:More picky?
R:Picky.
I:All right. That makes sense. What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:What is it that makes something right or wrong? The belief that there is a God I think has a lot to do with that. Because if there was no God and in order to believe there is something right and wrong, you’ll have to believe it's right or wrong per se because it just helps things go better or doesn’t help things go better like a society. You know if you said that murder was okay, well your society might be running without….like there being a God. If you believe there is a God, you believe that means you have to be doing well and he has set commandments for us for what is right and what is not right. Did that answer it?
I:So where do you think you got your moral views from? Where do they come from?
R:Well, my parents taught me. Is that…?
I:Yeah.

R:I read the Baha’i writings.  Yeah.  That’s totally how I know.  Sometimes I ask people like the Baha’i faith says that you should consult.  So sometimes I consult.  But I usually find that most people that you consult with don’t really know much about anything.  I don’t know.  I’ve found that.  Like, I’ll go ask people, should I give my dad $12,000?  And they’ll say “Yeah, because he raised you.”  And I’ll think that’s retarded because: he brought me into the world, of course he has to raise me.  So sometimes I don’t do that much, but I’ll just read the writings, see what they say.  That’s how I decide.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:In general, it’s easy.  Whether you want to, sometimes, is harder.  For example, even here.  Here certain people come in, you know they’re not going to tip you.  And so sometimes you just aren’t very excited.  But you have to remember, you have to be nice to everybody.  That sort of thing.  It’s not always easy. But I know.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:I think it’s gotten easier.  Because I think knowing most of my life, has kept me from making bad decisions that would make it harder now.  So probably if I dug myself a hole it might be kind of hard.  But I haven’t done that.
I:Hm. Have your views changed at all in the past couple of years?
R:I don’t know, I mean maybe just views of what life is like because I’ve moved out.  Now I have to make money.  It’s different to know what it’s like to earn money rather than having everything provided.  But, not so much.  I don’t know.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um.  I would say it’s the teaching of Baha’i.  I would say that all right comes from God and all wrong comes from yourself.  So sometimes I’ll think, well what would I do?  And what would maybe God tell me to do?  Sometimes that’s how I decide.  But that’s where I think it all comes from.
I:Okay.  Um.  What about consequences or feelings?  Some people say that you figure out what’s right based on whether the consequences are good for you…or whether you feel right about it.
R:Um.  I think consequence doesn’t matter.  Yeah.  There are things that may…if you’re dying of hunger, don’t steal.  The consequences .
I:So it’s really God’s will of some sort, but you would say God sort of…
R:Well his will being maybe what he tells you to do maybe during that day and age.  If he says don’t get politically involved, that creates disunity.  Maybe it would be really gratifying to go out there and campaign or something and prove people wrong but that only satisfies the desire in this world.  In reality, I’m spirit.  This world doesn’t matter.  So I don’t, I don’t do that.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  In terms of your faith.  Like what..we’re going to talk about religion more specifically later but…in terms of your conviction that it is sort of this source of teaching that is the basis for morality.  How did you learn that?
R:I would say through the writings.  Like, the Baha’i laws we believe in, and then there’s this guy who kind of expounds upon things more.  So it’s more like his explanation that makes things more clear.
I:Okay.  And is this something your dad taught you while growing up or did you?
R:Well, they always try to teach you that, in the Baha’i faith you don’t become it because your parents did.

I:So you just trust it more?
R:Yeah.
I:Yeah, okay. What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  What is it that makes it a right or wrong thing?
R:These are just not things you think about!
I:I know, that’s why we ask them?
R:What makes it right or wrong?  I don’t know.  I base everything on the Bible anymore so if it doesn’t line up with the word of God, it’s wrong.
I:Okay so you, where do you think that your moral views have come from, again?  You’ve kind of hit on it, but so where do you think you acquired your morality and your moral views?
R:Some from my upbringing and then a lot of my moral values if I thought I had them, I would may break them before I got in church, I believe in that, oops, kind of thing.  But I think a lot of them I’ve learned more just in reading the Bible and reestablishing my view points and my values.","Well, um, either experience or I don’t know, gut feeling or if you don’t know, trying to base it on some biblical principle. Mostly. I would say in general it’s easy, I mean I encounter situations every now and then where I feel like you get uneasy like what am I walking into and then it’s not really until you get into the middle that you’re like well I didn’t see that coming kind of thing, but. Easier. I think just like what I was saying with, I'm like quicker to just shut certain things down when I get an uneasy feeling about it and just not even allow the opportunity to present itself.

Um, where do your views of right and wrong come from?
R:Um, I think to some extent they come from my parents.  But at least within the past few years they’ve come more from me.  Because I’ve, I’ve gotten almost where I can analyze in situations, like how would I feel if that was me?  Like you know what, like, I’m, I’m mature enough to think of the other side of things.  You know like is it the best choice or you know if I do this how is it gonna make so and so feel?  And would I want that to be me?
I:So what is it you think makes something right or makes something wrong?
R:Um,  I think, I think, it has to do with people getting hurt.  And I don’t mean necessarily physically hurt.  An example with robbery, like you know, in kindergarten when somebody steals your favorite pencil, it’s just a pencil, you’re not hurt, it’s not the end of the world.  But to you it is, you know that was very important to you, you feel violated, you feel like that was not theirs, why did they touch it and you feel like nothing else is safe. You know like you lose your sense of security, I mean, not necessarily over a pencil, but you know, otherwise speaking, um, things like that, like if someone’s getting hurt in a situation, most of the time it’s wrong.
I:Okay.
R:You know, so.
I:So it sound like your standard of right and wrong now would be like the golden rule.  Do unto others as you want them to do unto you.
R:Yeah, yeah.  Like how would I feel?
I:So how would I feel, if I would feel crummy then I’m not gonna do it—
R:Yeah.
I:And it’d be wrong to do it to somebody else.
R:Uh-huh, basically.","Um, I think to some extent they come from my parents.  But at least within the past few years they’ve come more from me.

R:I go a lot on my instinct, if I feel guilty about it it’s probably wrong.
I:Okay.
R:Um, I go on what my parents have taught me, um what other you know, like other people have gone through and they’ve told me about it and I think, oh well maybe I shouldn’t do that.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to make like those decisions about what is wrong and right?
R:Pretty easy.
I:Pretty easy, okay. Has it gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years?
R:I think easier.
I:Really?
R:Yeah, because I just feel more comfortable with myself and my you know, I make more decisions in my life so I’m not as like, my god what is this gonna mean, it’s gonna change my life so I.
I:With more practice almost huh?
R:Yeah yeah, exactly, so.
I:Okay, well if you think of anything we’ll come back to it. What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, I think it’s wrong if, it’s like wrong in varying degrees as to how it hurts other people and how it hurts yourself, like um, if you do something and it benefits you  either short term or long term, but it hurts other people at all, it’s usually wrong.
I:Okay.
R:But it also depends on how it hurts them you know, like stealing is wrong because you know, it benefits you, hey I got this for free but, you know, it messes up the person who owns the store, maybe the cashier who’s working is gonna get fired because something was taken you know, on their watch, or whatever, um so I guess that’s mostly, or sometimes things are wrong just for your own self, like wrong because you know better or like wrong because you know it’s gonna turn out badly later on, even if you just feel like doing it right now.
I:So it has a lot to do with like consequences and what’s going on there?
R:Yeah, yeah.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Hmm, probably not, I’m one of those people that like sees it both ways, like murder is wrong but you know, but f it’s self defense it’s not wrong and stuff like that.
I:Yeah, okay.
R:Umm so, I don’t know if there’s anything that is like always always wrong.
I:So it depends on the situation and that kind of stuff.
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, where do you think your acquired your moral views from?  You were talking some about your parents.
R:Um, probably my parents a lot, parents, friends, um I guess mostly just parents.
I:And did, is it stuff you talked about at home or how did they teach you about morality?
R:God, I don’t even remember  just been ingrained.
I:For a long period of time.
R:Yeah  it’s just been ingrained in my head where, talking about it, don’t steal because and then they would tell me why, I don’t know I think they just taught me how to feel guilty from and early age so.
I:Was there anything that they taught you that you disagree with or you don’t do now?
R:Um, nothing I can think of.","I go a lot on my instinct, if I feel guilty about it it’s probably wrong.

Um, nothing I can think of.","The respondent primarily relies on their intuition and the moral teachings from their parents to determine right and wrong, emphasizing the importance of considering the consequences of actions on others, while also expressing a desire for societal values to shift towards greater empathy and community support.","I:So, one second, um, —so how would you say you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Um, I’ve gone back and forth throughout my life.  When I was younger it was what would my parents say?  Now that I'm older I base it sort of more on how does it make me sort of consider both choices, how do I think I would react to the one, how would I react to the other?  Generally if it makes me really nervous or if I'm really unsure about it or it makes me feel kind of guilty or bad it’s probably a wrong choice.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Pretty easy.
I:Do you think deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years?
R:I’d say probably harder, just sort of going to college, meeting so many different people and hearing so many different perspectives, it’s opened my eyes to other ideas that I hadn’t thought of before.  I took an ethics class, medical ethics, which was ridiculous.  You know we had some topics where I was like I have absolutely no idea either way, um, so it’s gotten harder yet I feel more confident in the choices I make but I spend more time considering.
I:Okay, so just because you have more information or something else?
R:Um, I think because I’ve had more information, I’ve had more life experiences, um, I can draw on past choices that I’ve made that may have been wrong, so.
I:Would you say your views about right and wrong have changed at all the last couple years?
R:I don’t think so, no not big right and wrongs, maybe little tiny ones but nothing major.
I:So what would you say you think makes something right or wrong?
R:Um,  I guess it, I mean it varies from situation to situation, it’s sort of things that are wrong unnecessarily hurting other people or yourself, um, and things that are right don’t necessarily not hurt anyone, but usually it’s not, something can be right and someone gets hurt unintentionally, that sort of thing.
I:Okay, um, so um, so do you think that something could be, could help someone and still be wrong?
R:Yeah—
I:And so, but you think also that something could be right and still hurt someone—
R:And still hurt someone, yeah.  It’s a hard line to draw.  It is definitely not black and white.
I:Okay, so if it’s not about hurting someone or helping someone per se, can you think of a situation, like if there’s something that would be say um, right but would hurt someone, what makes it right?  Like can you think of an example of a situation where that would be the case?
R:I guess I sort of believe sometimes in the  community versus the good of the, you know, so if it helps 8,000 people and one person dies in it or one person is injured, I would think that it’s right.
I:And then what about wrong?  Can you think of an example where someone can do something wrong but it still helps somebody or might helps people?
R:I’d say a lot of situations dealing with money where um, a lot of people are helped but sort of the whole idea behind it isn’t right and it certainly wouldn’t, wouldn’t be okay in other situations.  Sort of like it worked this time but kind of only by chance.
I:Like something someone got away with it, is what you mean?
R:Yeah.
I:Like a bank robbery or something.
R:Yeah, it doesn’t really hurt anybody but it’s wrong, it’s not your money and—
I:What would make a bank robbery wrong?
R:Is, I mean it’s not your money, I mean you have absolutely no right to it, I believe in working for your money.  Um, and it does indirectly hurt people, it’s not like people see it come out of their bank accounts or anything but that money has to come from somewhere so somebody’s going to adjust or somebody might lose their job over some mistake that allowed you to, I don’t know how it works but something like that.
I:Where would you say your ideas about morality or what’s right and wrong came from?  Like what influenced you, or?
R:A lot of it’s my parents.  It’s never really been; I guess they never like sat us down and said this is this and that is that.  It’s just sort of lead by example and when we were younger, discussing current events, things like that that we gained their opinion and definitely influenced me.","Um, I’ve gone back and forth throughout my life.

I:Where do your own views of right and wrong come from?

I:Um…what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um…probably the person who chooses to do it or don’t do it.
I:So if a person just decides that it’s right, then it’s right?
R:Um…no, not really, not like that.  Um, if it’s right, then maybe someone, if you think it’s right and then someone else, maybe not, maybe if they’re like good or bad, depending on what their background is, but if they believe it’s right too and you believe it’s right then maybe it’s okay.
I:So you think that if enough people believe that something’s right then it’s right, is that what you’re saying or no?
R:I think so.
I:Okay, let me ask you, I don’t know, so if the majority of people in the United States say…agreed that, um, you know, people who are on welfare should, I don’t know, be not allowed to have children or something like that, do you think that would be right?
R:No.
I:And what would make it wrong if…
R:Cause uh…
I:If the majority of the people wanted to do it, why?
R:Because a program like that was built to help people who really need the help.  For people who can’t support themselves and if they go against that that would be a little unethical.
I:So what if people in the society just wanted to change their mind and decided they wanted to do something different?
R:Then that would probably be wrong and a lot of people would be angry with that.
I:What do you think would make it wrong, like what makes it wrong, if the majority of the people wanted to do it, what makes it wrong?
R:Uh the fact that they just want to get up and do this without having any justifiable cause to do it.  You can’t just, you can’t really always go on the majority.
I:What, why, how do you know, if the majority is wrong, how do you know?
R:You don’t unless you get different views and opinions from other people.
I:And how can you judge between those opinions?
R:I don’t know, it’s up to the people really I guess.

Strong and sound, and um, because I am a God-fearing person, because I have such a close knit family, um, because, um, for whatever reason I always know that my dad know exactly what I’m doing, which is just terrifying to me, um, I have a very strong conscience, and I, I know, what would make my parents proud and what wouldn’t. And I know what would make me proud of myself, even more importantly, and what wouldn’t. I know what, I think, and even, I think what’s most important is, if I were looking, I were, when I look back on this situation, will I be proud of what I’ve done.  And I have, I have done things I’m not proud of, you know what I mean, but on the same token, um, I have learned that regret is not something that is healthy to live with, even if I do something wrong, do do something wrong, um, it’s something that will help me grow,  I will learn from the experience.  And I will move on, not forget, necessarily, but learn from it and move on from and become a stronger person because of it.  Become a little smarter next time.
I:Uh-hmm. Can you give an example of something that you would feel comfortable sharing that you’ve regretted?
R:Hmmm.  (long pause)
I:Trying to pick between the ones.
R:Okay, uh-hmm. Um, I was in a relationship, um, last summer. It was last summer, and uh, I was very much into, um, the guy who I was in the relationship with and uh, he, I, for whatever reasons I couldn’t see through the games that he was playing, and he ended up not only cheating on me but as soon as we um, had sex, I never heard from him again, pretty much.  And uh, I mean I did, but like, it wasn’t, it was never the same.  And, uh, it really, really hurt me, like, I, I’ve never, I, I don’t like putting myself in positions where I can get hurt like that and I’ve never felt so ashamed and so embarrassed and so heart-broken.  I was genuinely, genuinely heart-broken.  And I don’t think I’ve ever cried that hard in my life.  And um, um, like I genuinely had such strong feelings for him and I was so, I don’t think that necessarily I was, looking back on my relationships, I don’t know whether or not it was love, but I’ve never felt so strongly as I did for this guy. And I, I still, he’s still messing with my head.  Like, we don’t, we’re friends again, but it still hurts to have a conversation.
I:Yeah.
R:Like, it, it hurts my heart, um. I don’t, well, I don’t like to say I regret because I really, really try not to regret things.  I don’t necessarily regret it, I just wish it had happened differently.
I:Okay, so what would wished happened differently?
R:Um (pause).  I wish, I wish I hadn’t have put myself in the position, um, of, being used the way that I was.  I wish that um, he had at the time, had more respect for me than to treat me the way that he did.
I:Um, what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:Hmm, I think that’s every one person’s interpretation of it, I don’t think there, I mean, I don’t think there is one right or wrong to anything.  I think that it’s what one person’s conscience takes from an experience, what one person feels, um, has been, not necessarily, uh, there’s so many different ideas out there and there’s so many different thoughts and beliefs that, I, hmmm, (pause) I really do think that it’s each individual person’s choice to decide for themselves, for the most part, what is right or what is wrong.  I think that, um, yeah, because, um, one person can feel that something, like for instance, I, I feel comfortable talking to you about this, but like, for instance, the um, KKK, they feel that what they’re doing is completely right and who are we to tell them that it’s wrong.  You know what I mean?  But they’ve been taught for so long that that’s what’s right, and nowadays, if someone’s, for instance a gay person, um, the general consensus is what they are doing is wrong.  Who are we to say what’s right or what’s wrong, that’s what they feel that they feel comfortable with almost.  You know, like, I don’t know, I, I think that it, it’s every person, I mean, I know there is a generally accepted right or wrong for everything. There is what society has us to believe what is right and what is wrong and for the most part, I will stick by that, but there are some things that really I don’t see where believe have the nerve or the right, um, to say that is completely wrong, do you know what I mean?

R:I think my parents raised me pretty well to know what’s right and wrong—
I:So when you say know, are these like general rules that you could like express in like sentences or is it a feeling or intuition, like tell me what it is to know?
R:It’s a pretty good intuition.  I feel like I have a really good intuition on what’s right and wrong and granted I, I through experience have realized that there is always a gray area for every right and wrong answer.  Um, but I feel like I'm a big believer on the golden rule of do unto others so I think it’s, I feel as though it’s pretty self-explanatory what is, if somebody could get hurt in any way, if somebody, if it’s going to be harmful in any way, shape, or form to anything or anyone, don’t mess.
I:Do you think that something could be the right thing to do but have negative affects on people and vice versa?
R:Yes.  I think that for example, being honest about certain things, um, if they could affect someone in a negative way but at the same time, it’s again the gray area concept. Like there’s always a gray area for every right and wrong answer, it’s just weighing out which one in the end because I know that like for a lot of situations what’s going to happen right now may not be right but in the long run, what’s better for the greater good?
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?  Would you say it’s—
R:I'm pretty good at deciding what’s right and wrong.
I:Do you think it’s gotten any easier or harder over the last couple years, stayed the same?
R:I think as I’ve gotten older it’s gotten better because I’ve been able to look beyond what’s going on Friday night and I’ve been able to look beyond what just affects me and I’d be able to look at there is a bigger picture because I'm more mature.
I:So that happened gradually?
R:Mm-hmm .  More experience.
I:So have any of your views about what’s right and wrong changed in the last couple years would you say or not really?  Any particular views?
R:Not really.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:That’s in the eye of the beholder.  That’s a very gray area question.  Makes something right or wrong?   Um, if the great, if the effect of whatever it is that is right or wrong in the greater picture is going to be more harmful than beneficial than there’s really no point in doing it.
I:When you say more harmful than beneficial, do you mean, do you think there is a difference in who it harms?  Like are there certain groups of people where if you harm them more it matters more?
R:Hmm, I mean people are people, um, it depends on the situation.  I think it really depends on the situation.
I:So where would you say your ideas about right and wrong come from?
R:Come from how I was brought up.  Comes from personal experience.

Um, how do you decide or know what is good and bad or right and wrong in life?
R:I kind of, I don’t really have a problem with you know, debating whether, whether I should do something and if it’s right or wrong.  I kind of, I’ve never really put myself in that position to have to decide something like that.
I:Okay.  So, do you just kind of do whatever you want and not worry about if it’s right or wrong?  Or do you just feel like it’s pretty clear and you make your decisions, and.

I:So, it’s been easy for you, you think?  Deciding what’s right or wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Has it gotten any easier or more difficult over the past couple of years?
R:Um, well I think just getting into high school and you know with lots of stuff that people, kids do like drinking and drugs and whatnot, I think that’s made it, I guess that would make it a little harder.
I:How do you typically decide what to do, then, if you’re kind of questioning what is the right approach?
R:Ask your friends.  Yeah.  I talk to my, I probably talk to my friends, my really close friends, and see what they’d do.
I:Do you usually take their advice?
R:Um.  Well, I don’t really, I don’t really talk to them about really serious stuff.  Well, maybe the advice I take would be kind of stupid, but.  Um.  I do take their advice, unless I feel that what I think is better, but, usually we all have the same kind of opinion.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Mm, well.  I think everyone already has a sense of what is right and wrong.  What makes something right and wrong?  Well, I think it’s right if it’s not hurting yourself or other people to do it.
I:Okay.  Um, you said you have a sense of right and wrong?  Where do you think that comes from?
R:Well, I think it comes from society.  I mean most, usually what people do, is what society says is good, you know, or this is bad.  And a lot of people follow like the 10 commandments and everything and I’m not religious but those are good things to follow.

I:Okay.  Do you feel like there are any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Are there any what?
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong, or not.
R:Well, well obviously hurting someone, or you know, really physically harming anyone.  Even emotionally, if they, I think it’s always wrong to treat people, well, I think you should treat people how you would want to be treated.  Then, you know, anything, oh, capital punishment, we kill our people and I don’t really know what to say about that.  But, what was the question again?  Terrible memory.
I:That’s fine.  Talking about actions that could be always wrong.

R:I don’t really have trouble with deciding whats good or bad, right and wrong I went to a Catholic school for twelve years and all that and I had some sort of moral class or ethics class and moral code taught to me for all those years.  I know what's right and wrong.  I don't have any internal debate about anything.
I:But you said that you disagreed with a lot of the teachings in your school?
R:I disagree with the religious teachings.  But morals and those sort of values I think are pretty standard no matter what religion.  They all sort of basically say the same thing.
I:So in general, would you say it's pretty easy for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Yes.
I:And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder in the last couple of years?
R:I don’t know about that, its been sort of maybe a little more difficult, meeting different people who do different things and deal with people from different cultures and what not.  For than dealing with any particular sort of conflict or anything like that.
I:So you said that you basically have kind of a feeling about what is right or wrong, right?  So what do you think that the feeling is, or you know like how you know.
R:My conscience, I guess.  Just how I've been raised my values throughout the beginning of my life.  Whatever I, how I feel is gonna be the right decision, what would make me I guess maybe happiest or better off, and what will please others in the situation too.
I:Is the primary, when you're thinking about a tough decision, what's the main thing that, is it about like the outcome for the other person, or how it makes you feel, or, like what was the?
R:I'd say put all of it together.  I think its maybe something like the situation like that, but there are other kinds of situations, like maybe going to class or not.  Pretty basic choice, but I mean like a lot of kids don't go to class, and they don't have a problem with it.  I have a problem with not going to class.  I missed class once and that was because I had to go back home for a funeral.  It was a big deal and I still was upset about missing class.  But that's still my conscience.  I can't not go to class.  I mean I know my parents are paying for it.  I try, I don't know how much each class is worth, but I would feel terrible not going.
I:Okay.  From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Probably from my parents and from school.

I:Okay…that’s not bad, so then yeah, almost a month after, but uh…and…where would you say like, say if you’re looking at what somebody else does and you had to judge what like whether like what they’re doing is right or wrong, where did you sort of learn, where do you think you picked up the standards by which you judge if they’re right or wrong?
R:Well, where I picked it up was that I used to do it all the time and then I just started realizing what was worth doing and what wasn’t worth doing and so, basically I just did it long enough for it to just hit me and say well this ain’t right, don’t do it no more.
I:Right.  What, what kind of stuff were you in on or?
R:Going around breaking windows,
I:Uh-huh
R:Slitting tires.
I:Right.
R:Kicking mailboxes off their stands, things like that.
I:Right.
R:Stealing bikes.
I:Were you in it like with your friends or…okay…
R:I stopped hanging around them.
I:Okay, you got different friends or you kept some…
R:Yeah, I got friends that basically like to sit and talk and just play a game or something, watch TV or something, not go out and cause trouble.
I:Yeah, I gotcha.  And this was all when you lived in Lexington?   Have you ever…oh go ahead sorry.
R:Well basically if I was to come along another person like that I’d basically ask them not to come around any more.  So I wouldn’t pick back up on doing those same things again.","Where who? Mine? Basically I just think about it really.  If I think it’s wrong then I ain’t gonna do it but if it’s right then I’ll do it, but. Well most things that make me think about it is my niece though.

R:I don’t know really.
I:So if you had to make a decision between something that maybe was a difficult decision, what would go through your mind as you weighed your options?
R:If I had to go through a difficult decision?
I:Yeah, yeah. Like a moral dilemma.
R:If it were only me, I’d just deal with my problems by getting it out of my way and not worry about it.
I:Do you feel like in the last couple of years it’s gotten easier or harder to decide between right and wrong?
R:No.
I:What would you say it is that actually makes something right or wrong?
R:Just the person’s decisions, I guess.
I:So that person that has to make the decision?
R:Yeah.
I:So is it more about like the consequences that would come about choosing one thing over the other?
R:Uh-hmm. If I was in a situation where someone was trying to get me to do something that I know that would get me jail time, I’m going to look at him and tell them they’re fools. They can do it themselves.
I:So the consequences are sure there. What about like feelings? Are there any kind of feelings that would make something right or wrong?
R:No.
I:What about like rules or laws? Like if something was against the law, does that always make you wrong?
R:Yeah, really, I don’t know. It’s kind of a tricky question.

I would even, on the school bus, because on first grade everyone is really short, I would crawl under the seat and people’s legs would be dangling, and I would yank them from underneath the seat.

R:Not really.
I:You’re just more clear on the things that you think?
R:Right.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it’s all relative based on society.
I:Like in your own, when you think about it is it mainly, like, what other people believe, or is it consequences of actions, or is it
R:I think it’s a whole combination.  I think, like, parenting plays a huge role, but I also think all the people’s reactions in society might even play a larger role.
I:What about rules or moral rules or principles, things that are just always wrong?
R:No, I don’t believe in anything that’s definite.
I:Where have you acquired your moral views from?
R:I guess mainly, probably, from my parents and from my friends as well.
I:Have your parents talked to you about this specifically or do you just pick them up from?

R:Good and bad and right and wrong.  Um, I, you know I’ve grown up with Christian beliefs and reading the Bible and so that’s pretty much the biggest um standard that I you know, that I strive towards, so, yeah that’s probably the biggest one.  And obviously you know the teaching, like what my, what my parents taught me and stuff.
I:Do you struggle much with deciding between right and wrong or do you think it’s pretty tough in life or pretty easy, or how would you?
R:I think, I think it’s pretty easy, like I think everyone, everyone knows what’s right and wrong and even if they’re like, oh, I’m so lost, like really, I think everybody knows and if you, I don’t know, if you choose to not be realistic and not to see what, what you’re doing is wrong then you know that’s your decision.  I think everybody knows what’s right and wrong.
I:Okay.  How do you think people know?  Where does it come from?
R:I just think it comes from inside you, I think just everybody is born with, with a knowing of just what, what’s right and what’s wrong and like, like um, you know you don’t, like if, just like you know, human nature like if um, you know, you, if you grow up, like okay if a bunch of people are on a stranded island and, as babies, and they grow up together, like they’re not gonna kill each other, you know because that’s human nature not to kill each other, you know it’s just stuff like that.
I:Okay, has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past couple years?
R:Um, it’s, it’s pretty much the same.  Like the temptations are probably stronger, just because you know I’m getting older and there’s more temptations to choose from  but it hasn’t really gotten—probably a little bit harder, but you know.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Oh, gosh.  I like these questions.    I just have to think about it.
I:Okay.
R:Um, I think that um, like, um, what makes something right and wrong.  Wow, that’s like one of those questions like it’s, like everybody knows, it’s so easy but then when you try to explain it.  Um.  I think what makes something right and wrong is when, like rules are made to protect you and like you know, like, I know, I know a lot of people are like oh blah, you know, like the Bible is a bunch of bull and it makes your life boring and stuff and like, I, I’m not gonna be closed-minded and pretend I don’t understand where they’re coming from, like, but like, I don’t know, when you, when you like abide by laws, life is, life is so much easier and they protect you, like God’s not like, oh, you know, I’m gonna play with you and make rules because I’m angry you know, like people stop at rules until they’re in deep trouble and they’re like wow, I really wish that I hadn’t done that, I really regret that, so, um.
I:Okay.
R:Did I, did I sort of avoid the question?
I:No, I think you answered it.
R:Okay.
I:I mean it was about what makes something right or wrong, so I think you’re kind of saying right are things that are, that protect you.  Wrong ________________ .
R:Yeah.
I:Um, do you think there are actions out there that are always wrong, in themselves?
R:Yes.  Like—
I:Can you think of examples?
R:Yeah, like murder is always, well, yeah.  Like murder is always gonna be wrong, I mean, not, not self defense, but you know, hate like, hate crimes are always gonna be wrong, any kind of hate crime.
I:So, can you think for a second what’s behind those things that you think makes them ultimately wrong?
R:Things that are, I don’t know, like what makes doing something wrong?
I:Yeah, or why, what is them that makes them always wrong, so like murder, hate crimes, what is it about those things that are just wrong?
R:Something that hurts other people, um, something that is, is destructive, that is selfish, that is um, harmful.
I:Are there some things out there, just to be really difficult, just to get you think a little more--?
R:Oh yeah.
I:--that are complicated and that people do get hurt but at the same time, some people benefit, like I’m thinking of war or something like that, how do you think about those things?
R:About war?
I:Yeah, or we could use war for an example if you want, or anything you can think of where people are getting hurt and those things that you said that define something wrong, but on the other hand, some people would say there’s benefits from it, so.
R:Yeah, I think um, I mean, I think good can come out of every bad thing, you know?  And so, you know I mean, every, everybody’s heard it but it’s true, like you know without, without um, without bad things happening we could never know what good things are, without dark we wouldn’t appreciate light you know, so I think you know there’s a definitely a validness  in that.

Um…I don’t think you really do, I don’t think anyone can really tell what the outcome is going to be, but um…but…I mean they can sit there and weigh out the pros and cons before they do something, I’m sure.  I don’t think anyone really knows. I just sit there and figure out what the outcome is going to be, and then just decide.

How would you say you normally decide or know what is good or bad, right and wrong in life?
R:How do I know?
I:Decide or know.
R:I guess I just know. Decision-wise what’s a good or bad decision, is that what you mean?
I:I mean how do you normally decide between right and wrong?
R:Like do I take this candy bar or don’t I?
I:sure
R:I guess I just know. I mean I guess I was just taught that in life by my parents. I guess they taught me that from the beginning.
I:Generally would you say it’s easy for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Yes, I don’t really have to think about it now.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past couple of years?
R:I would say that it always gets easier.
I:Why?
R:I would just say the more experiences that I have the easier it becomes to find out what effects a certain something I do can have on someone else.
I:I don’t want to stop you, I just don’t know how well the recorder can pick up what you’re saying from over there.
R:No problem  I was just saying that sometimes right and wrong isn’t as clear cut as you grow older, it’s kind of more of what kind of impact will this have on somebody else. That’s how I feel about it. So it gets easier with experiences to make those decisions.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know, I really don’t. I guess it’s just the effect that it’s going to have on someone else.
I:The consequences of it?
R:Yes
I:And what kind of consequences for you would make something wrong?
R:If it was going to hurt somebody else or hurt me or ruin somebody’s life you know, those kinds of things would make something wrong.
I:From where do you think you got your moral views?
R:Probably from my parents. I would say that I think it is a mixture. My dad’s not really the forgiving kind, he’s not really the kind of person that can see the other side. He’s kind of more of a cut and dry, right and wrong type person. My mom is the opposite. She’s forgiving, she can see where maybe you would have made that decision and why and it might have been right for you, where with my dad if it’s not what  he would have done, it’s not right.

I:Yeah, what kind of books?
R:I don't know, I like fantasy books, so maybe that’s why I like the chivalry kind of stuff cause way back then like in the medieval times there was always like, honoring the ladies and everything and, and I think that’s cool and I just want someone to do that for me.
I:Yeah.  Um, okay, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Is there some sort of values that you have?
R:How the, how the, I think it’s how it will affect other people, you know like you gotta try to keep the balance of neutral between everyone, you know like you don’t want everyone to be mad at each other, well they don’t all need to be like I love you with everyone, you know just as long as everyone can get along, then you can do what you want as long as people get along, so, I think, like in the whole world sense, like everyone in the whole world, as long as people get along, then you know.","Yeah, I know what’s right or wrong most of the time, and sometimes I don’t do the right thing just because the wrong thing is what I want to do, you know like I’ll just like I don’t really do anything to hurt anyone else or whatever, but I don’t necessarily do the right thing all the time. Instead of what I should, Yeah, like I’ll do what I want to do but it won’t be as extreme sometimes, like that way I’m not doing anything too bad but I’m still doing what I want to do you know. Yeah. I guess my parents or my aunt and my grandma, but, I guess so.

R:I kind of look at in the long run, like in the whole scheme of things, like you know, I just kind of like, I’m a pretty peaceful person.  I’m really easy to get along with, like, I don’t want him to see me.  I’m pretty easy going.  I work at a restaurant, and oh the drama there, I swear to God.  But I try to stay neutral with everybody, but they come and bitch to me and I don’t like turn around and say oh but she said and that said, and she said this.  I’m just like, oh that sucks.  And I don’t want to just start anything.  And no one ever talks about me.  So I’m a pretty peaceful person.  I have good karma.   I like to think I have good karma, except me and my friends went out and egged cars.
I:And what?
R:We egged cars, that was the first time I ever did that in my life, so, so.  And then last night we stayed up until 8 o’clock in the morning cleaning my boyfriend’s room, so maybe that evened it out.
I:So when you egged cars, did you say to yourself this is wrong, I shouldn’t be doing this or not?
R:No, because I mean that’s not too harmful, it’s not like we were throwing bricks in peoples windows or you know, we dragged a couple trash cans a couple of feet, you know, but it was just mischief.  You know, my car’s gotten egged before, my house has gotten egged.  But we kind of did, it was someone in a convertible.  It was asking for it.  It was on the side of the road in the middle of the night with the top down.  I mean who does that?  Who does that?  But I mean that’s the worst thing I’ve ever done.  I mean I’ve never hurt anybody or like, did anything bad like that.  I mean I’m 18 years old and that was the first time I ever egged anybody.  But it was fun.  It was fun.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s pretty easy, I kind of just, go with the flow of things, and whatever comes up I’ll figure it out.  And I’m a firm believer that you know what, it doesn’t matter what happens now, in the end things will work out.  Things can only get so bad and then they’ll turn around and get better for you.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Probably easier because I’ve gotten like a bigger perspective on the world.  After I graduated and went to college, I like totally like my mind just like shifted gears, the wheels were turning and like that.  So just a lot different, and they gave me a lot more experience and stuff like that, to be able to make decisions now.  So it’s gotten a lot easier.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, it’s all somebody’s perspective you know?  Like you might think it’s right for somebody to have an abortion, and I might not.  You know, it’s just who, what you believe is right and what you think in your head is right or wrong.  I mean there’s like things that obvious, like killing is wrong.  But like, not always.  It just depends on like the situation and your perspective, like the whole, what, what’s going on.  You know, you wouldn’t just go up and randomly kill somebody.  But if someone murdered your family then you’d you know, you’d want them dead, because they brought that on other people too.  So it just depends on your perspective of things, and how the situations and stuff.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves?
R:Um, I don’t know.  Taking over someone’s free will.  Everybody should have the will to do what they want.  I mean as long as it’s not affecting everyone else free will should be happy.  And everyone else should be happy.  That’s one thing I believe in is free will and stuff.
I:So what if someone is hurting other people, do you think
R:What?
I:If someone’s hurting other people should their free will be taken away?
R:Like physically hurting someone?
I:Or, emotionally or should they be made to stop if they’re hurting other people?
R:Well we might not necessarily take their free will away.  But like do something about it if they’re hurting someone then figure out, you know, why, or like, you know, put them in jail, where there’s like totally no free will.  We don’t have to control their lives as long as they’re like in a safe environment where they cant hurt anybody and you know, but if people, it depends on how extreme the case, you know.  If someone’s just beaten someone else up, then it’s different if someone murdered the town of Chicago, you know.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Um, all my experiences in life, I would imagine, like my family and my friends a lot.  I mean TV, I mean just like seeing things that happen on TV.  And books, you know, I mean just like everything, every minute of your life you learn something different.","I kind of look at in the long run, like in the whole scheme of things, like you know, I just kind of like, I’m a pretty peaceful person.

R:I try to think about how it’s gonna affect me in the future and you know from somebody else’s perspective what would they what would be an objective point of view of this thing, and you know what my parents would think about it and what I think about it and if I want to do it or not, so.

I:so in general is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:it’s pretty easy, I mean you should know what’s right and what’s wrong, but a lot of people don’t or don’t care.
I:and in the past few years has it gotten easier or harder?
R:some things have gotten easier and some things have gotten harder.
I:like what?
R:M3:I dunno. For awhile there was the whole right and wrong thing I didn’t know if it was going to be right to stay with the guy that I had been dating for awhile because we were comfortable around each other you know and we were happy sometimes, but sometimes we would fight and argue all day long, so I didn’t know if I should stay with him or not, so that’s pretty much it.
I:so what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong? You mentioned that you think about the long term effect on your life but what’s the deciding factor?

R:Like abortion?
I:Like, about yeah, where, I mean, where did his idea of right and wrong come from?
R:Well like, I guess from the Bible I mean, it’s, it’s, blasphemous to have an abortion, like it’s against the Bible.  I don’t know and I guess since he’s finished school and you know whatever you’re doing to aim yourself to finish school then that sounds like the right thing to do.
I:Your Dad went all the way through college.
R:Mm-mm.
I:Okay.  And he gets his ideas of right and wrong largely from the Bible?
R:Yeah, from experience.
I:Um, so where do you think your views of right and wrong come from?
R:Probably from, some of them had to come from my Dad but other things just come from like what I’m feeling at the moment, like, like that’s how I feel and that’s what I’m gonna do, like if I used to cut class, if I don’t feel like going I just wouldn’t go, that’s wrong, it’s not right, but it’s the easiest thing to do so I did it.
I:Okay so convenience is one, or convenience or whatever’s easiest is one um, reason you make decisions and what you’re Dad thinks is another reason you make decisions and what makes you feel good.
R:Yeah.
I:Those are the things I think you’ve mentioned so far.
R:Yeah.
I:Where do those come from do you think, where do you, where did you get those ideas?  Well, for example, where does the idea that it’s easy and therefore that’s the, that makes it okay?
R:Well I don’t know, probably just being lazy.  Cause I mean, I think everyone wants to be lazy but you can’t afford to be lazy, and since I could always afford to be lazy then like I’ve always done it.  So like I don’t know, I do a lot of lazy things, like if I just don’t wanna get up, I just won’t, I mean if I have to get up to go to work, I would get up.
I:Mm-mm.
R:And it’s just, just things like that.
I:Okay, um, can you give me an example of ah, how you would, through a decision making process, so in others words, tell me about when you were trying to make a decision, how you went, step A, step B, step C, get to the, what you thought was right or wrong?  It can be little like when you’re deciding to go to class, okay, you have a class, and you don’t know whether to go or not.  All right, so now, tell me what happens.
R:Well, I think of, if I have something more better, that I feel better about, think of something better to do, if I had anything better to do.  And then I would think about, I mean, I would hardly ever think about getting caught, cause I would just stroll out of the building and like nobody would think anything, but if I was like dodging cars and like looking all around, they probably would be like oh she’s probably skipping and they’d run after me.  But I would always just stroll out like I was supposed to be leaving, I’m like, I’d probably think of how many days I skipped, so maybe I wouldn’t lose credit.  Then I could just forge like a class and then they’d probably give me the day off, I would think about all of that, and I usually ended up leaving, cause I could forge the teacher’s signature and then have like an excused absence.","Well, I always ask my Dad, like with school I was like will this be right or will this be wrong and he was like— Yeah.  And he was like it seems like the right thing to do, you’re having such a hard time in school, not because you can’t do it but just because you don’t want to do it because they’re so boring and like I don’t know, Tita got pregnant like, even that I was like, Tita’s pregnant and he was like oh, that’s, that’s exciting, cause you know like, I guess like an older generation, when somebody got pregnant like they’re bringing a new life into the world, they should be happy, it’s like a joyous moment, I guess when a teenager gets pregnant it’s kind of like abortion or get yelled at like, and he was like oh that’s exciting and I was like oh, okay, I guess so.  So like she didn’t want to have an abortion cause she already, she had already had one so I was like okay I guess you’re gonna have a baby, like I didn’t know what, I mean, of course I’m gonna support whatever she wants to do, but I didn’t know if I was supporting the right thing, and my father was like you know, you can support her, that’s good. Like abortion? Well like, I guess from the Bible I mean, it’s, it’s, blasphemous to have an abortion, like it’s against the Bible.  I don’t know and I guess since he’s finished school and you know whatever you’re doing to aim yourself to finish school then that sounds like the right thing to do. Mm-mm. Mm-mm (yes). Yeah, from experience. Probably from, some of them had to come from my Dad but other things just come from like what I’m feeling at the moment, like, like that’s how I feel and that’s what I’m gonna do, like if I used to cut class, if I don’t feel like going I just wouldn’t go, that’s wrong, it’s not right, but it’s the easiest thing to do so I did it.

R:Based on what my dad’s taught me and, based on what I’ve learned in school about, you know just general things and about the Bible and God. So pretty much that kind of stuff, and based on how to affect other people and myself.  You know, cause if it’s going to kill someone I’m not going to do it.  You know, that’s horrible.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it depends on how the person is, um, deciding.  It depends on the heart of the matter and other things.
I:What do you mean?
R:Like if they’re um, if they’re doing it for the benefit for only themselves then it could only be a little bit wrong.  But if they’re doing it for the benefit for themselves and others, you know, like if it could affect others then I think it could be, you know, it just depends on how the person thinks of it. Like I don’t think God looks at the decisions you make, he looks at the heart and that’s what I think bases,
I:You said you wouldn’t, uh, you said you wouldn’t do something if it was going to kill somebody, um, why, why would that be something wrong to do?
R:Because I believe everyone has a chance to live.  Everyone should have a chance to live, even if they’ve killed someone else.  Like not really, like they shouldn’t live to kill someone else I mean like I think they should be able to have a second chance.  God gives second chances you know?  He gives like 5,000 chances, so.  You know and, so I think that everyone has a reason to be made on the earth to.  And once they fulfill that that’s when they should be able to die.  I’m not going to try and help them to not die, or to die or something, if they um, like you know if it’s not their time to die, they’re not going to die, basically how I see it.
I:Would you extend that to say that you wouldn’t do something to hurt somebody? I mean would it be whether it’s emotionally or physically?
R:If someone’s going to get hurt anyway.  Like I would try and make it so they weren’t hurt as bad.  Like based on the decision, but if it’s where either I get hurt or someone else get hurt, I’d rather I get hurt cause I know how I’m going to react to it, but I don’t know how they’ll react to it. So I’m kind of like,
I:Why is it important to try to keep people from being hurt?  I mean why does that matter?
R:Well, cause I know how it feels to be hurt.  It’s horrible and so, you know, I don’t want them to have to go through that, you know, so, I’m kind of like, like with my best friend and stuff, she’s the same way I am.  She would rather have herself get hurt than someone else.  So a lot of times we’re trying not to get each other hurt, so, it’s really kind of funny, but yeah.  I don’t know, I don’t like, I don’t like seeing people hurt either.
I:How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?  How do you specifically make that choice, those decisions?
R:I ask other people a lot of times.  And then I kind of go with what I think.
I:Based on what they say?  What other people?  Your friends, your dad? Other people?
R:My friends, my dad.  Sometimes I pray but not as much as I should.
I:So when they give you their input, their advice or what they would do, what do you, how do you go about weighing that out?
R:Um, I kind of think,
I:And it might help if you have an example, I mean that might just tell me how you would decide one or another situation.  But if you don’t that’s okay too.
R:Well, I was going out with this one person one time and he was very like sexual and I was kind of like, you know, um, my dad doesn’t want me into that cause he wants to protect me from ruining my life or something. So he was kind of like, he was kind of like into you know all that kind of stuff, and he was trying like to get me to do things with him and I’d be like no.  You know, I don’t want to.  You know I don’t feel like I should until I’m married even.  You know so it’s kind of like that.  And um, so basically I kind of thought what should I do?  And I would ask my dad what would happen if I did this or I told you this and what would you say if I was pregnant or something.
I:Freaking him out probably.
R:Yeah.  He thought I was pregnant for awhile cause I asked him that (giggling).  I was like no dad I’m not pregnant.  And he’s like are you sure about that, you’re not screwing around or anything like that and I’m like NO!  So it was like, it was really funny though he doesn’t believe that right now.  He trusts me.  And um, but I basically would ask him what, if you were in that situation, what would you do and that kind of think and stuff like that.  And I told my friend Larissa and Ana E.  Those are like the only two people that I even told.  Cause Vanessa, she’s kind of like you know, she would be like, you know, I can’t believe that happened or something, or I can’t believe you know.  Like, he was asking you that kind of stuff, you know and then she might go and tell someone else or, and like I trust her but not fully completely kind of thing.  Cause she um, yeah, so.  I’d ask them and anyway it would be like, they would be like, well you shouldn’t you know, what would God do?  You know and they ask what would God do? And I would say he wouldn’t be doing any of that kind of stuff you know? At least until he was married and that kind of helps me also, you know I kind of knew already that I would tell him no and stuff.
I:So you think in some ways that you kind of knew what your friends would say and you knew you wanted to do, and in a way it was a way to help you make the decision you already knew you wanted to make?
R:Yeah.","Based on what my dad’s taught me and, based on what I’ve learned in school about, you know just general things and about the Bible and God.

I:Okay, um, do, are there any situations, or has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last couple years?
R:I have to say it’s kind of just been the same in my life.
I:Okay, things aren’t getting more complicated or more clear in terms of that, your decision?
R:Yeah, a decision is kind of more of a simple thing for me to think of.  The only way it would be considered a harder, is just when we and my Mom don’t agree with something together and then that’ll take a little while to configure out.
I:So if you, say you and your Mom don’t agree about some, some course of action or whatever, how would you, what would you base it on, for you to figure out whether you think it’s right or wrong?  Would you go with what she thinks or are there other criteria you might use?
R:Um, mainly we’re gonna argue for a while on it.  And then eventually, she’s just gonna continue on until she wins.  That’s just kind of how she is, because the only reason I say continue on until she wins is because I’m just through with it.
I:Right, you don’t persist?
R:I don’t care to argue, I don’t enjoy it, so eventually I’ll just try to leave.
I:Okay.  So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  What’s the basis on which you decide, that’s right, that’s wrong?
R:Um.  Ah.  Again, that’s mainly opinion, um.
I:Okay, so what, what kind of, you said, how you feel about it, what kinds of feelings would tip you off that, if I feel this way, that’s probably a wrong thing to do?
R:Ah, if I feel it’s wrong, it’s mainly based of .
I:This is a tough section of questions.
R:I would have to say I guess if it’s something I dislike, ah, hate, don’t enjoy, um, wish for a different source of—
I:Do you have any idea where your, where your feelings come from, like, you know, for instance, you, someone offers you coke and you look at that and say, no, that’s, that would be wrong for me to take coke, but somebody else can look at it and say that would be okay, what, why would you see that differently?  Where do your views on that come from?
R:Um, I’ve never had coke, so I can’t tell you exactly what it’s like, but just from what I’ve understood of what it is, it doesn’t seem to be something I would enjoy to do, based of what it can do to me in the long run.
I:Okay, so, maybe part of it might be the consequences of that?  Would that figure into your decision?  Like, what you think would be the outcome of taking that course of action?
R:Um, it could be there.  And also, just the idea of what I experience from it.
I:Okay, so you might base it on whether you think you would enjoy the experience or not?  Or you’d have a positive or negative—
R:Or, if I have done it and then eventually decide that I, that it really isn’t something I want to do.  For an example, have, did I ever tell you about cigarettes?
I:You probably did, but you can tell me again, because I’m not remembering exactly.
R:Ah, a while ago, I did think cigarettes were awesome and went through starting for about four months I would have three a day and then I converted to five a day for the next month and then eventually six a day and then that told me, hey, um, obviously it’s gonna continue to grow up or grow on or whatever  and um, and it does taste horrible and so I don’t really know why I’m doing it.  I did, for a while, would take nicotine and, as in rolling tobacco, and put it into a bong that’s like so big, fill that thing up and then take it all down and hold it in, making it fall over, like I would lose ability of what’s going on in my body and I found that somewhat entertaining for a little while but obviously it’s not gonna be good for my brain and after six months I decided to really get off nicotine, which was, I’m assuming a lot easier for me than anyone else that’s continued on it for a while.
I:Because you had just been smoking for about six months, you said?
R:Yes.
I:So, what, what it was, what was it, the key that made you decide you wanted to stop, what were the factors?
R:That it was advancing, with more.
I:Okay, so that, and you were thinking about what it would do to your body, eventually, was that part of it?
R:Um, well, I kind of knew throughout the time that obviously it does stuff to people because obviously have done, or gotten things, cancer is a good example, and ah, that, yeah it’s just mainly the reasons that it, well, tastes bad, it’s gonna do something to me, and it advanced.","How do I decide?

I:Okay, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:The morals, I guess?  Like what, how, why is it wrong and why is it good, like um, like if you’re hurting someone then that would be wrong, so the right thing to do would not to, so, it’s kinda, it’s kind of um, how you’re brought up I guess, by what you’re taught.
I:Okay so, if, if we go back to the other question, do you think that pretty much it’s about everybody decides what’s right or wrong, why, why is it wrong to hurt someone?
R:Because you’re inflicting pain on another person, so.
I:But what, why does that matter if?
R:If it’s right?
I:Yeah if, if what, if it, you decided that that’s the right path to go, I mean what is it that would make that wrong?
R:If it, like war kind of?  Like killing people in war.
I:So war would be wrong or war would be right?
R:It would—
I:I just want to make sure I understand what you’re saying.
R:Um.
I:
R:I don’t think war is right, cause they, you really don’t get anything from war except everybody dying for a piece of land that’s probably gonna get taken back anyway later on and, in a couple hundred years, but, so, depending how it’s right or wrong, I guess it’s what you feel is right, I don’t really, can’t, I can’t really explain it.
I:So it’s, so the, even the, to the extent of on the one hand you don’t want to hurt, you want, you want to draw the line at um, it’s not okay to hurt somebody, but how do you, why is that, let me, I just want to ask you one more time, why is hurting somebody, do you think that’s wrong if it’s dependent on whoever, whatever we all, individually think?  If you want to get something from me, for example, and you could take me down in one of your wrestling holds, assuming your shoulder wasn’t screwed up, why would you not do that, why would it be wrong to hurt me to take whatever I have?
R:Cause I don’t have a right to, cause everybody has their own right to their, for their, for themselves, they have the right to live or the right to be themselves, so you can’t force to take away their right from them, so.
I:M8:Okay, um,  can you give me, maybe one or two examples of, of M8:how, of, of deciding, of a dec—how you make a decision about, I don’t M8:know, something in our life that, whether it would be a right or wrong, do M8:you have any examples you could think of?  Like I mean, ah, I can throw M8:some ideas out but ah, I’d rather you, you know.
R:Like a scenario of right and wrong?
I:Yeah I mean something’s that actually happened, maybe happened in your life, you know whether it’s about schoolwork or whether it’s about you know, snagging something from the store, whether it’s about whatever.
R:M8:Like cheating on a test?
I:M8:You just took a big test today, so.
R:M8:I can’t cheat on it.
I:M8:You can’t cheat on that one, really, huh.  Yeah, I mean, what, what, ah, M8:how would you decide about that?
R:M8:If I would cheat on a test or not?  I would say I would cheat on a test for M8:the grade, but then it’s wrong because you’re not doing what’s right because M8:it’s not right to cheat because you have to do it by yourself without help, so M8:but then you get the grade, though.
I:M8:So the, so back to your sort of payoff.
R:M8:The payoff—
I:M8:Of cost and benefits, so that if you didn’t get caught, the, the benefit M8:would be a better grade, assuming you cheated off the right person.
R:M8:Right.","I guess my parents, what they taught me. The morals, I guess?

Uh, how do you decide or know what’s good or bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:Uhm, I guess the whole basic good and evil kind of thing. Maybe, the way I see it—how I see if it’s good or bad, I judge it that way.
I:How do you see that? How do you…is it easy for you to decide right and wrong?
R:Most of the times, I think, it’s pretty easy to see. But then I always kind of, like, as I, like, want my parents to be more open, I try to be more open. So I don’t really accuse anyone until I know why they’re so upset. So I really don’t get on anyone unless I know what’s going on. And if not, I kind of just let it go about itself.
I:Uh-huh. Do you think making those decisions about right and wrong have gotten easier or harder over the last couple years?
R:I think it’s gotten easier, because, back, I think, I was more accusing. I’d, I viewed whatever I thought was right, and you’re wrong. But now, I’m kind of a little more open to what everyone has to say. I don’t really blame anyone.
I:Let’s go back to how you said, that whole good and evil thing and that kind of stuff. What is it that you think that makes something right or wrong?
R:I guess, it’s been based on, like, my morals, I guess. How I think things are good or bad. Uhm, I guess I get it whether it hurts people or not? Or how much it affects someone, I guess.
I:So, something would be wrong would be hurting, like, other people? Hurting yourself? And hurting in what ways?
R:I guess, in more ways than one. Just general if it causes any disturbance, then, it could be. And then, depending on what causes it, would make it bad or good, I guess.
I:Uhm, so that would be sort of your dividing line between something that’s right or wrong is whether or not you’re going to have a disturbance or hurt somebody else or...?
R:I guess, how bad it affects other people.
I:OK. Uh, are there any actions you think that are in themselves right or wrong? Like, regardless of whether it hurts or not other people? Like something could be wrong in itself?
R:Uhm. I don’t know. Like, what would, what do you mean by that?
I:Well, I don’t know. Let’s use your example of your friend you got mad at for cheating at cards.
R:Uh-huh.
I:Was cheating wrong? Or was it...? What was it...?
R:I don’t....
I:Did you think that that was wrong?
R:I thought that was wrong, not because.... It wasn’t the cheating that really got to me, it’s just that he would break that trust between us. Because we trust him that this was just a fair game among each other. And then, he broke it, and, like, he stole. It’s that, he didn’t cheat. He, like, stole from us.
I:So the issue is more.... Let me ask it, not say it. Is the issue more trust or is the issue more stealing?
R:I would say it’s more on trust. Because we trust him not to steal. So. If he stole, like, I guess that would be the same way. But then, this is another, this is kind of more on the trust factor, because we’re all going in thinking that this is just between friends, but....
I:Would that be the same, say, you’re at Long Beach*, and you’re at your dorm. And you know these people, and you don’t really care about them. And you have a poker game, or whatever, and somebody cheated there. Would you get as upset as you did with your friend?
R:I wouldn’t, because I wouldn’t know him, so. I’d get mad, but I wouldn’t get as mad.
I:So would that be, so you wouldn’t judge that action in the same sort of moral sense as you did with your friend?
R:No.
I:And that’s because of the relationship and the trust?
R:Yeah.
I:And where do you think you’ve acquired your moral views? Where do your moral views come from?
R:I think it’s come from my parents. And then some from, I guess, my religious background. Not a lot of it.

R:I guess from what you’re told and also how I’ve been raised.  So certain issues I guess it’s just on what I believe and I, when I think about it, I don’t know where I got the assumption on whether that would be right or wrong but I kind of, I guess I just go with whatever I feel at the time.  I just answer with whatever I, what’s ever in my gut, I guess—
I:Like a gut feeling—and in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I guess if my gut feeling isn’t good enough, then I just kind of weigh out the options on which one is, which one I guess would make sense logically, I guess, if like, if I was choosing between right or wrong, which one seems more wrong and like kind of just based on the facts on which one does not work in my eyes, I guess that’s how I would choose.
I:So, let’s just, I want to understand how you’re thinking about this, so you would whatever the issues is, how do you judge logically in your mind as you’re working through this, what’s more right, is it because of consequences or because of some external principles that you believe in or other things?
R:I would guess how, um, depending on whether it’s good or bad I guess that would come down to whether that person is doing wrong to others or doing wrong to himself, whether that’s being based on if it’s good or bad or not and then if he, if I, if they’re doing harm to themselves or others than I already regard that as bad.  But then if there was an issue of whether they were doing harm, but then there’s other factors involved than, harder to decide whether he’s doing, what he’s doing is wrong or not, then kind of, I’d have to, if that ever happened I would just weigh out why his reasons for it and then his, and then what he’s actually doing.  So I guess, so that’s how I would.
I:So in general, whether there’s harm involved to other people, would about to the person?—Yeah.
R:That himself, then if it’s harm to others then I'm more inclined to call it bad because if you’re hurting others than it’s not, like you shouldn’t be doing that anyways and if anything, like I would regard hurting others before hurting yourself as worse off, I would guess, and then if you’re hurting yourself, that’s depended on why you are, which are mostly never good so it’s always, always kind of a dilemma when people are doing that kind of thing.
I:Would you say that in the last few years deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder?  Since the last time we talked?
R:I would say it’s harder now, just getting older you run into different situations and more circumstances—
I:There’s more complex situations you have to think about?
R:Yeah, I would say, just thinking whether it is a good thing or not, to do, or—
I:Where would you say your moral view come from?
R:I guess from all around, mostly from my parents and what they’ve taught me and then just from what you learn in society-wise, they tell you never to do that or to get in trouble by the law and certain things like that so I would say it’s just all kind of from everywhere I go really and then people that I meet and things change and your ideas change on whether you think it should or it shouldn’t be.

So certain issues I guess it’s just on what I believe and I, when I think about it, I don’t know where I got the assumption on whether that would be right or wrong but I kind of, I guess I just go with whatever I feel at the time.  I just answer with whatever I, what’s ever in my gut, I guess— I guess if my gut feeling isn’t good enough, then I just kind of weigh out the options on which one is, which one I guess would make sense logically, I guess, if like, if I was choosing between right or wrong, which one seems more wrong and like kind of just based on the facts on which one does not work in my eyes, I guess that’s how I would choose. I would guess how, um, depending on whether it’s good or bad I guess that would come down to whether that person is doing wrong to others or doing wrong to himself, whether that’s being based on if it’s good or bad or not and then if he, if I, if they’re doing harm to themselves or others than I already regard that as bad.  But then if there was an issue of whether they were doing harm, but then there’s other factors involved than, harder to decide whether he’s doing, what he’s doing is wrong or not, then kind of, I’d have to, if that ever happened I would just weigh out why his reasons for it and then his, and then what he’s actually doing.  So I guess, so that’s how I would. That himself, then if it’s harm to others then I'm more inclined to call it bad because if you’re hurting others than it’s not, like you shouldn’t be doing that anyways and if anything, like I would regard hurting others before hurting yourself as worse off, I would guess, and then if you’re hurting yourself, that’s depended on why you are, which are mostly never good so it’s always, always kind of a dilemma when people are doing that kind of thing. I would say it’s harder now, just getting older you run into different situations and more circumstances— Yeah, I would say, just thinking whether it is a good thing or not, to do, or—  I guess from all around, mostly from my parents and what they’ve taught me and then just from what you learn in society-wise, they tell you never to do that or to get in trouble by the law and certain things like that so I would say it’s just all kind of from everywhere I go really and then people that I meet and things change and your ideas change on whether you think it should or it shouldn’t be.

I:From your parents?
R:My upbringing.
I:And in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Easy.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Easier.
I:Why?
R:Just being older and more experiences and knowing how to deal with people and situations.
I:Ok.  Have your views about what is right and wrong changed in the past two years?
R:I’d say a little bit.
I:How so?
R:New things – drinking and all that.
I:Ok.  So you – so what do you mean by that, though?  The drinking is now something acceptable to you?
R:Yeah.
I:And it previously wasn’t?
R:Yeah.
I:And what affected that change, do you think?
R:Just the college life.
I:Um hm.  Ok.  And what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Deciding.
I:What do you mean?
R:Say, just from the standards, laws and – don’t speed, even though you think you’re going safe.
I:Um hm.  Is that the only thing?  That – so when you personally think about what’s right and wrong, do you go by society’s standards?
R:No.  It’s also your experiences and yourself.
I:So how do you – how do you know what’s right and wrong?
R:A combination of your upbringing, what society tells you and your experiences and –
I:So do you think that people have different standards of what’s right and wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:And how does that work?
R:That’s how they are and what they believe to be right.
I:Do you think that there are moral absolutes?  That there are some things that are just wrong and that, like, should be wrong for everyone?  Or is everything sort of relative?
R:Relative.
I:You think so?  And so, like, is there anything that is always wrong?
R:I think murder would always be wrong.
I:And what makes it wrong?
R:Just to take someone else’s life, not your own – it’s not what you should do.
I:Ok.  So is stealing always wrong?
R:It depends if – like, if you’re actually starving, and you wanna steal some food, I’d say go for it.
I:Ok.  So do you think that there are kind of consequences that make things wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Like, what sorts of things?
R:Consequences will make you think about what you’re going to do.  So if there’s no consequence, why not do it?
I:What about the idea of guilt?
R:Guilt .
I:And so where does guilt come from, do you think?
R:I have no idea.  Our conscience?
I:Ok.  I could have asked this already – so what do you mean a conscience?  Does everybody have a conscience?
R:Yeah.
I:Where does it come from?
R:I guess your upbringing.
I:Um hm.  So you still think it’s sort of, like, rooted in society?

R:Just cause, well if you’re gonna, usually you’re gonna get in trouble for doing something wrong so, if there’s something you’re gonna get in trouble for it’s usually pretty wrong, so.

I:I see. Has it been harder to decide between what’s right and wrong?
R:I mean I know, that’s the thing, I know what’s right and wrong. I know, like what’s good and bad, it’s just deciding whether I’m going to do it or not.
I:so it hasn’t gotten any harder over the last few years?
R:no.
I:well what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:what makes something right or wrong?
I:umhum.
R:well morally I guess you could say, if it goes against what my beliefs are religious-wise it’s wrong, or certain things like that. And I guess you just learn it growing up. I mean, I can’t explain how I learned right and wrong, you just know I guess.
I:so you, what you’re saying you were taught that way?
R:yeah.
I:and pretty much from what you’re saying as well, you’re taught in a way that’s pretty clear, pretty easy for you to decide now what falls in whichever category, and you haven’t been stuck anytime recently?
R:uhuh. I mean it’s not about being stuck, it’s like this is wrong. Like, listening to the music I listen to, it’s kind of wrong you know what I mean, the things that they talk about, but I don’t care ‘cause that’s what I like to listen to. it’s not about oh is it right or is it wrong, it’s just right or wrong.
I:okay, so where did you get your moral views from?
R:my parents probably.
I:and how did they communicate that to you? Can you think of ways that they did that?
R:I don’t know ‘cause I never, when I was a kid I didn’t get into any trouble at all, like at all. So I was kind of seeing that other, observing of kids getting into trouble.
I:any other avenues by which you received the understanding of what’s right and wrong?
R:not that I can think of.","like how do I figure out what’s good or bad or right or wrong? well, people say you can rationalize it, in my life there’s no rationalizing, you’re gonna do bad or you’re gonna do good, for some reason you just know.

R:I think everybody knows what's right and wrong.  It's--you--everybody's--I think everybody's smart enough to know right and wrong.  That's like, basic knowledge, right and wrong.  You decide to follow it, to do it or break the rules.
I:And is that easy or hard for you to decide, to see what's right?
R:I mean, depends on how, what kind of situation you're in.  Like certain situations, it's easy.  It's real easy.  Like, I'm not gonna go kill somebody, because, that would ruin, like, you know what I mean?  Like there's no point.
I:Yeah.  What about other--what would be ones that are less obvious.
R:Less obvious is like--
I:Killing somebody--
R:'Cause everything
I:But I mean in everyday life--
R:'Cause to me, to me everything seems obvious.  I, I really just choose to break the rules or to do it, you know?  Like--
I:So you know when you're doing something wrong?
R:Almost every time.
I:And has that--has making that decision become, gotten easier or harder for you over the last three years?  To do the right thing or to break the rules.
R:Easier.
I:Easier?
R:As you get older it's always easier, just--you know, I don't need.  There's a lot of things you avoid.
I:So, ok, I just, so why has it gotten easier for you?
R:There's no, there's no pressure to do any of it.  Like, there's never pressure.  It's just--it--you are who you are.  And you just decide.  I mean, if I wanna do--if there's something I do wrong all the time, I just do it wrong all the time.    But, if not, you just don't.
I:What is it you think that makes something right or wrong?  You say that everybody that, that most everybody knows what's right or wrong.  But what is it that actually makes something right or wrong?
R:I think there's like a--There's universal right and wrongs, but then there's certain things that--Whatever culture believes is right and wrong, 'cause certain people, they've never heard the things that I've heard, so they, they would--they don't have the same judgment I have, because they've grown up different.
I:What would be the universal right and wrongs, do you think?  And what would make them universal, I guess?
R:Like the commandments are basically--I, I would THINK they're universal.  Even though, I guess, I-- I kinda think like, since you're born, like, you don't wanna grow up and kill people, or you don't wanna grow up and hurt other people.  Like, having a good relationship with people around you.
I:So you think the Ten Commandments, unless you , those are your example, are sort of a universal right and wrong stamp.
R:Well, not all the commandments, and some of them are do in that religion, like--So some about what God and them--
I:So what is it about those that makes them universal?  Is it because they will happen if you break them, or because God gave them to us, or because they're in the Bible, or because--just because?
R:Well that, well--I guess I'd say that came to my head because that's what I know.  But if you're in another religion, I'm sure they have their own thing, like they would refer to.  But I kinda think that certain things, that, they'll blend together.  Like, I don't see, I don't really think that there's a lotta religions that agree with murder or agree with stealing or stuff like that.
I:So, blend together, you mean like, they'll blend together what's going on in the culture?
R:Like, 'cause the Ten Commandments, they have things like, like:  Keep only the Sabbath, or like, false gods and stuff, where that's gonna be, that's gonna be completely out of a different religion, but I'm sure in that religion, they don't agree with killing people. So, like, certian things will blend in.
I:And your moral views, where have you gotten your moral views from?
R:From my parents a lot, and then, just certain stuff I decide to do.  Like, I, I can agree or disagree, like.  But mostly just from my parents.

R:Yeah.
I:Do you think that deciding between what is right or wrong to do has gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?

So it can get harder, because then you can be unhappy.  But then why do you choose the right thing?  It is like you know; you have a peace about it and you can go on.  So it is circumstantial.
I:What is it that you think makes something a right or wrong thing?  How do you know what makes it right or wrong.
R:How it affects others, and how it affects you.  If it is just morally wrong, I know everyone has different morals but at the same time someone may have offended you and they are coming at you, but hitting them still isn’t right.

R:I think it is a feelings thing.
I:So where do you think that you acquire your personal moral views about things?

R:I don’t know, like it’s like, the law, like if you go against the law it’s wrong.
I:How, how do we know what to make into a law, is there something beyond the law that makes things right or wrong?
R:God.
I:God does?
R:Yeah what he wants you to do.
I:Okay.  So how would you know what God wants you to do?
R:Pray.  Ask him what’s right or wrong.
I:Do you, okay um, where do your own views about what you think is right and wrong come from?
R:Mm, my parents, what they taught me, God, the law.
I:Mm-mm, okay.
R:What my friends do.
I:What your friends do, helps you to know right and wrong?
R:No, but it helps me choose from right and wrong.
I:You like, so you mean you view, you look at what they’re doing and then you think about what you want to do?  Mm-mm.
R:Yeah like if my friend Brandy, she’s normally really, really bratty, most of the time and so I look at her and then I go I don’t want to act like that and so.","I don’t know, like it’s like, the law, like if you go against the law it’s wrong.

Um, I have some questions about morality.  Thinking about good and bad, right and wrong, wise and unwise, just and unjust and how, how do you ah, how do you know what’s good and bad in life, right and wrong?  Or do, first of all, do you?
R:I know.  Yeah, I know.
I:Yeah.  How do you know that?
R:Just by um, like Christian beliefs and laws and just—
I:Like governmental laws.
R:--you know, you can, you can just feel what’s right and wrong, you know, well, stealing this is wrong.
I:So you mean like, a conscience?  Or?
R:Yeah.
I:Yeah, okay.
R:Do I always listen to it?  No.
I:Okay, but you know it’s there.
R:Like, yeah, like I know drinking is wrong.  I should probably not hang out with some of the people I hang out with, it’s wrong.  But, I do it anyways because it’s fun.
I:Why is it wrong to hang out with people?
R:Well, no, just like some of the people are not very good influences, and they do pretty bad stuff, but they’re my friends and so.
I:What is the bad stuff they do?
R:Drugs.  Drinking.  Stuff like that.
I:Drugs, like pot or hard drugs or what?
R:Well a couple people, mm, mostly pot.  But some of my friends do harder drugs, like crack and stuff.  Which I would never do.  I do pot.  But I don’t—
I:But you hang with them.
R:Yeah.  They’re my friends, you know, it’s their life, they can do what they want, as long as they, you know, it doesn’t—
I:All right.  Um, so you’re saying, you pretty much always know what’s right or wrong and it’s a separate matter whether you do that.
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Do you mostly do what you think is right, or, and just occasionally do, or do you, are you--?
R:It’s, I don’t know.  It depends on the day.
I:Yeah, okay.  Um, has, has dealing with moral issues, right or wrong, good or bad, gotten harder or easier in the last two years, since we last talked?
R:Um, knowing that it’s right or wrong, just as easy, you know.  I, it’s easy to know what’s right or wrong.  Choosing what’s right or wrong is easy, too, it’s just the fact that I normally choose wrong more than right.
I:Okay.  So it’s not gotten easier or harder, it’s just that you’re choosing somewhat differently.
R:Yes.
I:And why do you think that’s changed in the last two years?
R:Because doing what’s wrong is more fun than doing what’s right.
I:Okay.  Do you think there are any costs to doing what’s wrong?
R:Probably.  There’s just none yet.
I:Okay, so you’re just enjoying, you’re having fun, doing the wrong.
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.
R:It’s probably gonna catch up with me one of these days and I guess I’ll deal with it, then.
I:Do you have any idea what the catching up will look like?
R:Getting caught drinking, going to jail, I don’t know.  Getting fined. I, I’m more of the influencer, I’m more of a leader than a follower.  I don’t really, like if someone will tell me something, what to do, I won’t listen to them, I’ll do whatever I want, pretty much.
I:Okay.  All right.  Um.  Now, so, you think certain things are right, and certain things are wrong.  What is it that makes things right or wrong?
R:Your beliefs.
I:Like, what?
R:Laws.  Like—
I:So if the government says, this is against the law, that makes it wrong.
R:Well, technically, yes.  It is.
I:Does it make it illegal or does it make it morally wrong.
R:Oh, illegal.
I:What is it that makes things morally wrong?
R:Your beliefs, your morals, your religion, your parents, stuff like that.
I:So, what are, um, okay.  But, if your parents, let’s suppose your parents were weird and they said, it’s wrong to drive a green car.  You would say, it’s not wrong—
R:Are you crazy?
I:I mean, you may not like that, but it’s not wrong.  So, how is it that parents saying something makes it wrong?
R:I don’t know.  It’s just the way things are.
I:So what, so what makes something wrong, just because it hurts somebody?
R:Because it’s wrong, because it hurts them?   I don’t know.
I:So, anything that hurts somebody is wrong?
R:Yes!  That’s what I believe.  Yes.
I:Okay.  What’s wrong with hurting somebody?
R:Because it hurts them.  I don’t know!
I:Well, I’m not trying to terrorize you, here, I’m just curious how you think about it.
R:It just, it just is.
I:So you’re saying—
R:There’s just some things, it’s just the way things are.
I:Okay.  So it’s a general, moral rule, that people should—morally, should not hurt each other?
R:Yes.
I:Okay.  And you think that’s just the way things are?
R:Yes.
I:In the universe, it’s just the fabric of reality?
R:Yes.
I:Okay.  Earlier you said you thought morality might have something to do with religion?
R:Yeah, kind of.
I:How might it?
R:Well—
I:Or, in what ways?
R:Some people, like Christians, believe in some things and Mormons believe in some things and Jews believe in some things and it’s each to their own.
I:Uh-huh.  So when you say that you’re a Christian, do you think that Christian faith influences how you think about moral right and wrong?
R:It used to.
I:It used to.  Meaning, it doesn’t anymore?
R:Not really. Well, the people who believe in them, they think it applies to everybody, it should apply to everybody.  But, it doesn’t.  It just depends on if you believe in them or not.
I:So you’re saying, you don’t think the 10 commandments applies to everybody, it’s just if you believe in those?
R:Well, I think they sh—um, I’m confused.  I don’t know.
I:Okay.
R:Like, they, to some people it doesn’t apply to them because they don’t believe in it, but other people believe that they should apply to them, other people like, it does, like Christians, the 10 commandments, think they apply to everybody, just people choose not to do them.  And then, but the people who don’t believe in the 10 commandments think that they don’t apply, that it’s not there.
I:Okay.  Um, what about, you know, in the old days, the Romans used to feed people to lions for entertainment.  Now that’s clearly hurting somebody.  Do you think they were wrong, morally?
R:I just think they’re messed up .  I guess, I don’t know, that was their time, their day and age.  So.
I:So you find it hard to judge that?
R:I don’t like judging other people.","I know.  Yeah, I know.

R:Conscious I guess.  From what my mom taught me.
I:So your mom taught you stuff and that’s stuck with you and now when you sort of go about living that’s what you rely on?
R:Yeah.
I:And in general is it easy or hard for you to know what’s right or wrong?
R:It’s easy, it’s just making the choice of doing it.
I:What you think is right or wrong?
R:What I think.  It’s pretty easy because like I said I’m really open to things and so it doesn’t really, and I don’t have any regrets just because at that point and time it’s exactly what you wanted to do so why regret when you can’t change anything, you know?
I:Have your views on what’s right or wrong changed at all in the last three years?
R:Yeah.
I:In what way?
R:Well I guess not in the last three years, but from like the time I was younger until the time I moved out.
I:How did anything change?
R:I realized that some of the things your parents say not to do is more so because they are really concerned and worried about you rather than it being wrong to do.
I:So it’s okay, but it’s just…  But are they right that it’s risky?
R:Yes, they are right that it’s risky.  You just gotta be safe in what you’re doing.
I:So you used to think they were morally wrong and now you just think they are cautions?
R:Umhmm.
I:Like what would be examples of that?
R:Like drinking or going bungee jumping or skydiving, stuff like that.
I:Have you done bungee jumping or skydiving?
R:No, I want to.
I:Okay.
R:I want to really bad.
I:So be careful about it.
R:Yes.  Like my mom always scared me out of doing stuff like that.
I:So do you have kind of a risk attracted personality?  Do you like living on the edge?
R:I do.  I do a lot.
I:And that’s part of your sort of rebellious whatever?

I:Do you think right and wrong is the same for everyone then?  Are there like moral absolutes?
R:Unfortunately a lot of people have probably been taught wrong.  But I think right and wrong, it’s very distinct.

Definitely my grandmother cause you know she’ll always talk about you know drugs and drinking again, you know she’ll always talk about that you know different situations she was in you know, it’s really helpful when she puts her opinions and situations she’s been in, it really helps out a lot.
I:Okay, um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong? Are there guidelines you follow?
R:I really don’t think there is a guideline to where you can follow yes or no, it’s just basically gut instinct, if you’re that kind of person you do this thing, if you’re not, you know you don’t.  I really, it’s all about gut instinct for me, I really don’t follow any guidelines.
I:Do you think there’s um, even though it sort of feels like the gut somehow, do you think, where does that gut get developed or those ideas?
R:Friends and grandparents.  Definitely them, cause you know like I said I’ll put myself in my friends situation and I’ll get stuff from my grandmother and it just, that’s where it comes from.
I:Okay, um, so can you give me some specific examples maybe?  Things you were thinking about when we started out and were saying sometimes it’s tough to decide what’s right and wrong and you kind of have to choose, whether it’s go by your gut or what your friend would do?
R:There’s been one time really recently, like maybe a week ago that I went out with my friends you know and then they left, their parents picked them up and I thought my mom was supposed to be picking all of us up so I was left with one guy and so you know I called my mom and I didn’t want to tell her that a guy was dropping me off so I just said that some of my like my mom’s, my friends parent was gonna pick me up and then you know he drives and he brung out um a little marijuana joint, you know I’m just like no, you know I’m just gonna call my mom and everything so you know I got out of the car, I really, I was not thinking at all, I just got out, I just saw it and I was just like no that’s okay cause I know if I did, I'd get killed.  My mom would smell it right away and she’d lock me in my room so basically,
I:So that instant when you saw it and decided to get out of the car, you made a decision of what was
R:Yeah, I didn’t, there was no gut instinct on that one, there was just get out of the car now just,
I:And you said you thought of what your mom would say so she’s made it pretty clear to you that that is wrong,
R:Yeah.
I:So in that situation you sort of went on what your parents, what your mom,
R:Yeah, but like my mom really hasn’t talked about it much, she doesn’t, well she pretty much hasn’t talked about it at all you know I’ve been through some stuff that she’s, she’s really grounded me for a while, you know so I just did not want to do that again, that was not fun, so I was just like,
I:Was it all for reasons about your mom or was there anything that sort of you’ve decided in your head that you’re not gonna smoke marijuana and there’s reasons why or is it just really don’t want to get in trouble with your mom?
R:I really think it’s just you know my actions will probably cause a reaction to her hand to my face.

R:How do I decide?  Ah, if I feel, if I feel like something is wrong, I’ll either tell someone or I’ll either ask someone what’s going on or if I, if nothing, if they don’t say that nothing is going on, you know, I usually just kind of stay with them, keep quiet and see what’s, see what’s really going on.
I:Yeah, you said sometimes you feel if it’s right or wrong, where do you think those feelings come from?
R:Instinct.  Like if, um, if everyone is quiet, like cause like now I know like how everyone reacts if something really bad is going on, like my Aunt’s wedding and everything.  Because there’s a whole lot of different reactions and you know, if we asked what was going on, they’ll usually give the default answer, nothing, you know.  Like everything’s fine, they’re just PMSing or something like that, they’ll be like go ahead and go off somewhere and so if I get that kind of response or something, I’m gonna know something is up and I’m gonna wanna learn
I:Okay, in general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s pretty easy, because I mean, I’ve been, I’ve grown up with a nice family and everything and they’ve taught me a whole lot of difference between right and wrong, and a whole lot of that comes from them.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:How you feel about it.  Like, my boyfriend, he’ll, like with the whole car thing, he’ll go racing or something like that and he thinks it’s perfectly okay but I’m, you know, he’s not gonna think it’s perfectly okay when he gets into a car accident or something, but I, I’d automatically think it’s wrong.  Um, I don’t know, I think my gut tells me.  There’s a whole lot of things we argue about, what’s right and wrong, but we all agree with it, one way or _______________  .

R:Yeah.
I:And in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?

R:How do I decide what is good or bad?
I:How do you know how to live, what’s right, wrong, good, bad?
R:I think that’s all just kind of, first of all, the way I was raised.  I know what’s good, bad, right or wrong and that’s what I grew up with.
I:Is it easy or hard for you to know?
R:I wouldn’t say it’s easy or hard because I make up my own mind and I think that’s all you can opinion, someone’s opinion what’s good, bad, right or wrong.   Like underage drinking: I don’t think that’s bad in my situation, but I was always responsible about it.  I never got over the limit.  I didn’t go anywhere; I didn’t put myself in a bad position.  So I don’t necessarily think that’s bad, the way I handled it.  But at some point I was fine, so I think it’s all relative to what opinions are.
I:So what is it, you say that a lot of it gets down to people’s opinion, what is it that you think ultimately makes things right or wrong anyway?  I mean if somebody makes a moral claim: it’s wrong to do something or it’s a good to do something.  Why, where does that come from?
R:Hmm, Gosh I don’t know.  That’s going to make my brain  happens.
I:Are there any perceptions that people have that are wrong?  Or if they have that perception is it right for them?
R:Yeah, I think a lot of people’s perceptions or their own opinions that can be wrong, it’s just like a racism claim or something like that and they may think that’s a quick way, not necessarily means it is, but-
I:So what’s the standard independent of their perception that makes their perception wrong?  I mean how would we know that racism or slavery or whatever is wrong?
R:I don’t think we really would other than that group consensus or idea - but it’s kind of just a majority-.
I:So it’s relative to sort of the majority view?
R:Yeah, possibly.
I:So, sort of a hypothetical, but so in the 1930s in Germany there was a lot of anti-Semitism, I mean it was fine to round Jews up and ultimately exterminate them-
R:Right.
I:And if that was the majority view would that in that context, in that time and place, would that be morally okay because most people thought it-
R:No…
I:Or would you say-no that’s actually wrong-
R:Yeah, see that’s a good one because I would say absolutely that’s wrong, that’s absolutely wrong.  But if you look at it from the perception of if I was in that time, just like everyone else, it might have affected my opinions even then if I’m going with the group consensus.  It might have seemed more appealing or more like the right thing to do, even though right now that’s of course, that’s wrong, that’s the wrong thing to do.  So I don’t know, I would say
I:So in parts of the Roman Empire there were if a baby was born to a family the father had like a week to decide if he wanted to keep it and if it would be part of the family and if he decided against it, he could just leave it outside in the mountains to die.  We’ve since decided that’s not the right thing to do, but if um, by the time you have grandchildren, things had evolved so that people think that again, it would be widespread, would that be okay?
R:I don’t think that would be okay.
I:Is there a reason or would it just be that’s how you were raised?  I mean is it something other than just your upbringing?
R:I think it’s something other, it’s got to be, I think that’s moral issue  I mean that’s a moral issue that I just don’t agree with.
I:So what makes it a moral issue?
R:Well, I don’t know, I'm trying to think of the right way to describe it, I just don’t agree with that thought of mind.  Yeah, I don’t know.
I:Some people we talk to say well there’s kind of a natural law in reality that there’s just certain things that are given that are just right and wrong and then some people would say God had commanded certain things and they’re right and wrong for everyone even if whether or not you even believe it and other people would say something like Utilitarian like maximizing pleasure, minimizing pain as sort of like a constant rule, or is there anything outside of just people’s views that make things right or wrong or make, judge people’s view?
R:Yeah, I don’t know maybe the natural approach; you just know what’s right and wrong.  I don’t know if I could go so far as to say it’s a God thing and I wouldn’t do the, you know, imminent pleasure thing, I don’t know, I'm not sure what really decides that.
I:Do you think all normal people have sort of a moral intuition where they just know it’s wrong and that’s as far as you can explain it?
R:Yeah.  I guess that’s how I’d put it.  I think that everyone, for the most part, knows, has a sense of right and wrong and that’s just part of who you are -feeling something is wrong-
I:Okay so if it comes out in the news that somebody has been apprehended for molesting children or whatever like that, then we would say there’s something objectively wrong with them.  If they don’t have a moral conscious themselves that tells them that’s wrong then they are not normal, you would make that kind of judgment?
R:Yes.
I:We wouldn’t just say well that’s their opinion?
R:No .","How do I decide what is good or bad? I think that’s all just kind of, first of all, the way I was raised.  I know what’s good, bad, right or wrong and that’s what I grew up with.

In my gut I feel bad when I don’t give the change, so, most of the time I’m going to give that person something.  But then there are times when I’ve had a bad day and I’m like I just failed my test that I studied for you’re not getting my change because I could be right where you are, you know what I mean, so it just depends.
I:
R:What makes an action right and wrong?  Well, a lot of times it’s the law, you know, what the rules are.
I:Do you think that they
R:No, because there have been cases where the law was found unconstitutional.  But I would say this far into our history of our country I think we’ve learned a lot from where we’ve from but as of now I would say there’s, I mean, it’s never a foolproof system.
I:Laws can vary from state to state, so how do feel about that?  Is one wrong is one right?
R:No, but in the eyes of that law or that city or whatever, you wouldn’t be wrong.  I mean, if you don’t follow it, an ignorance of law isn’t an excuse most, see this is very like theoretical stuff, I don’t know, we can’t go on, who knows what the answer is.
I:What do you think the answer is?
R:I think the answer is, well, you can’t really answer the question because I need, I’m more of a person of examples, give me an example, you know.
I:
R:Let’s say, okay, in Georgia* there are some laws that on the books that are against the law but people practice them.  Like sodomy, like you know, fellacio or whatever.  And that’s just when
I:Because that’s on the books that that’s wrong in Georgia* is it wrong?
R:I think it’s something that you can’t even call out, like, you, I think it’s an individual choice because like I was saying, when there are rules put into place, more than one factor can be in play.  I think when that rule was made, it was more of a religious factor, when nowadays, it’s not just, society influences it also, so kind of, the masses kind of outweigh just the individual law.
I:you actually like, I don’t know, what do you go to?  What is your like one
R:What is my first thought process and my second?  My first thought process is, I want to honestly say I do take account of the law, you know.  And then, when I want to say what defines my decision most is what’s going to be safe for my daughter which in turn what’s going to safe for me because I have take care of my daughter, you know.  Let’s say the law is ‘you can’t use your water because of the drought*’, but I had to use it for something that was needed for my daughter, then I would probably break that law and use water, you know what I’m saying, so in that case my daughter’s safety outrules, or in my opinion, overrules the legislation.
I:Do you think is has to do with like the types of consequences
R:Well, I think it’s in human nature is, if you’re not going to have a consequence involved with something negative that you’re going to do and there’s no negative consequence even if you do the action, then you’re more likely to do it.  I think we’re creatures of habit and there have to be laws and consequences put in place or you know society wouldn’t be able to run.
I:Where do you think you acquired your moral views from?

R:Um.
I:Curious about where you own views of right and wrong come from?
R:Well probably I guess from you know, what I’ve been taught through like the church or whatever, you know, like the ten commandments and stealing and some like that, that plays a lot into it and just I don’t know, I’ve been always taught to treat people with respect you know, kindness and compassion and obviously if you’re just being a, you know, if you’re not doing that, I guess, that would be wrong, or if you take other things from people, stealing I, I really have a problem with stealing, I guess that’s, that’s definitely wrong.

Okay, okay.  All right.  Ah, so um, switching topics a bit from that, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Good and bad, right and wrong.  A lot of it’s instinctual, I guess you know you should just, it seems pretty straightforward with what’s decent, I guess, religion plays a big part of it, you know.  Granted, I don’t know, like a Roman Catholic would do, I believe everything that’s taught as a, you know, like on abortion, I don’t know, I mean, I’m not sure what I think about that, I’m not sure what I think about the death penalty, you know and obviously there’s really strict things, I mean, obviously on simple every day matters, you know, don’t lie, cheat and steal, you know, just accepted in societal morals, you know, that I’ve been instilled through my parents, I think they did a pretty good job, you know, teaching me but then also living out you know, practicing what they preach and showing me the right way of being a decent, moral person.  I guess that’s just engrained, you know, then it’s been reinforced over so long that you’d feel bad if you would be to break, you know, something like that, so.
I:Okay.  Is it, ah, well, is it generally easy or hard for you to decide what’s right or wrong?
R:Pretty easy.
I:Pretty easy.
R:I mean, yeah, pretty easy.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:What it is that makes something right and wrong?  Judge, I mean, against like the moral code, I mean, yeah, I don’t know, if the, probably then you can get into it philosophically you know, is it divine dictation, I accept religion and know all that and yeah it is, um, so I don’t know.
I:Well what do you think?
R:I don’t know, divine dictation, it just seems like common sense, decent stuff, respecting somebody else as a person and showing them courtesy that you would expect to get and receive and whatever, you know, it helps to foster you know, respect and just well being amongst people would be, it seems like you know, granted, I don’t know if that’s a societal, and they decided to make it up through the course of whatever time or whatever or if it’s a divine commandment, I’m not sure, but something that respects people as an individual and tries to not harm them, if possible, but.
I:Okay.  Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves?
R:Always wrong in themselves.  Like murder or something like that, I don’t know.  Probably not, I mean, I, I think it’s really hard to say, there’s never, you know, to use such a definitive term as always and never, I mean, even murder if it’s in self defense or what if you’re saving 100 people, you know, like no I don’t think so.  To say always is really a pointed statement and I can’t agree with that.
I:How about rape, is that?
R:Rape?  Ooh, that would probably be one that would qualify, um, unless there’d be some really odd extenuating circumstances, um, but I, I don’t know.  That would, then it would be one, it’d probably be close to that, but, yeah, I guess.  But again, I mean, I’d want to take a look at the situation, you know, if it’s gonna save a million people, well, I don’t know, you know, that’s a moral quandary, but yeah.

R:Uh, I mean, just kind of values that have been reinforced, growing up.  From my parents, from church.  And then also, again, with Marines, but the standards that they hold you to, it kind of helps in making those decisions.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Um, pretty easy for the most part.  I mean, it’s kind of a gut feeling, that’s like, well, it’s kinda, you shouldn’t be doing that.  Um, I mean, I haven’t faced any huge moral, ethical quandaries, so…
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years?
R:I’d say maybe a little bit easier.  Just as you see more people, like, kind of, a negative reinforcement.  I mean and also a positive reinforcement.  I mean, as you gain more experience, you meet more people, you see how more people act, and realize, “Wow, that’s pretty, like, heinous”, or, hey, on the converse, “Hey, that was a good thing to do and that’s a quality individual”, and those traits kind of distinguish that person.  I think that’s kind of helped to clarify between the two.
I:Have your views about right and wrong in any way changed in the last few years?
R:Not terribly.  I mean, pretty, yeah, I haven’t had any wild, crazy changes in college, so for the most part, they’ve stayed pretty constant.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Why is something wrong?
R:Why is something wrong.  Well, I think it could be wrong for any number of reasons, depending on what the situation is.  If it’s just dealing with another person, on how you treat them.  I mean, kinda use, like, a camp song, where you want to make someone better than you found ‘em.  And if you’re doing something that’s causing them pain and consternation, er, you know, being unfair to them, I guess that would qualify as being wrong, um.
I:Why?  Why would those things qualify as being wrong?
R:Well, I don’t know.  Treat others as you want to be treated, I guess.  And if you’re doing something that you wouldn’t want someone reciprocating to you, and then, that’s just kind of reinforced through growing up.  But, like, you know, do unto others as others do unto you, so, you’d hope that it kinda comes through there.
I:Some people say that if it feels right, that it’s OK.
R:Well, I mean, then that’s kind of arbitrary, and whatever.   I  .  I mean, I think there are kinda some absolutes, like, hey, but, I mean, I don’t know.
I:What would be a ?  Laws or principles, or …
R:Good question.  Um, you know, I don’t know.  I think it ties in, I don’t know, with religion, just kind of a generally… I don’t know.
I:Where have you acquired your moral views from?
R:Well, just reinforcing, growing up from going to church and going talking with my parents.  And then again, just from observing other people and just thinking, “Wow, that was really heinous”, and I don’t, you know, I don’t want to…  If someone would be looking at me doing that same thing, I’d hope they’d be kinda disgusted by it.

R:Um, my faith I think.  Like I’ve gone to Catholic school since I was like in 3rd grade.  And it’s not like it’s been put upon me or anything, but, um, we, I’ve always had religion class and we talk about things like faith and like issues and current events and so I just think about, it’s given me time everyday to think about things like that in school.  And, I think, it helps me form my views on what’s right and wrong.
I:And what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, I guess the bottom line is if it hurts somebody.  And if it hurts somebody then it’s wrong.  Then it’s kind of like generalization of that.","My dad. Definitely. Bad.

How do you decide and know what has been bad and right and wrong?
R:I guess a lot of it’s like just like your gut reaction to like what you do, feeling like inside, sometimes I think I feel guilty for no reason, like when I apologize to my mom for telling her how I felt about that fight, I don’t know.  It’s just this gut reaction, probably based on moral things over time.
I:is it usually easy or hard for you to decide what’s right or wrong?
R:um, it’s, I think it’s easy to know what’s right and wrong, most of the time, but when it comes to like specifics, like certain things are hard.
I:so what kinds of things are harder?
R:like things like, I’ve kind of like resolved this one for myself about like sex, that I would rather wait.  But, sometimes it’s hard to know, is it because it’s morally wrong, cause like, would god want us to wait?  Or would god want us to do what feels natural, I don’t’ know, stuff like that, where you’re like, you could work it out either way, you could reason both sides and it’s hard to tell sometimes.
I:do you think deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder over the past couple of years?
R:probably easier, just like getting in touch with what I want and hoping that I’m doing the right thing, that what feels like it’s right is right, just like practicing it more…
I:oh like having more experience?
R:yeah.
I:okay, that’s fine.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:um, I guess first like there’s a couple of things.  What’s right for you in a situation, like what you need in your life I guess and then you can think about how you’re gonna affect other people.  And this is severely complicated I guess.
I:yeah it is really .
R:like what would, like what would Jesus do you could think of it that way too, what’s the right thing to do morally.  They all factor in I guess.
I:where do you think you’ve acquired your moral views? Like where do they come from?
R:I think a lot happened actually in high school like developing my views because of religion classes actually, just talking about stuff actually.  Especially this one class sophomore year with Mr. Santos* I remember, he was like a deacon candidate or something…
I:you went to a catholic high school?
R:yeah.

R:Common sense.  I am how my mommy raised me basically.  You could say her common sense.
I:So is it generally easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Depends on the situation.
I:What do you mean by that?
R:Whether to drink or not really depends on where I’m at, who I’m with, what time I have to be up in the mornin’.  Stuff like that.
I:So it depends on a lot of things?
R:Yeah.  If I gotta be up at work at four in the mornin’ I’m not gonna stay up ‘til two drinkin’.  Goin’ into work with a hangover is not fun.
I:That’s not a good thing?
R:Naw, we’ve all done that before.
I:Now has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder in the last couple of years?
R:It’s about the same ‘cause when I was in school, it was whether to cut out from class and stuff like that, well now, it’s whether to speed, slow down, obey the traffic laws, and I don’t know why I started talkin’ about that, ‘cause there’s a cop out there, that could be it.  Whether to do drugs has stayed the same in school from now.  And I have more responsibilities now ‘cause I have to have a car payment comin’ in, insurance, pay my cell phone bill, stuff like that.  And I was payin’ all that when I was in school, but it got a whole lot higher when I got out.  ‘Cause in school I was drivin’ an ’86 Caprice.  Forty miles a gallon.  Not fun.
I:Would you say your moral views have changed in the past couple of years?
R:Not really.
I:About the same?
R:About the same.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Your own personal view on it.  Along with the society that you live in’s view on it.  The majority of people that do drugs, they don’t think it’s wrong, and then they think the same thing with alcohol.  It alters your state of mind and how you feel.  If it was up to everybody else, all these drug-dealers and stuff, they would have it legal because they think that the only reason it’s not legal is ‘cause the government can’t tax it.  Same thing with moonshine, but it is legal to create moonshine, you can do that.  Just no more than a gallon a week.  Not that I would know that.
I:Where do you think you’ve acquired your moral views from?
R:My mom.  She’s, I hate to say it, people say if I had longer hair and was just a little bit shorter I would be my mom.  That’s sad.  Not just because we look alike but the way we act.

We like started going to church and then you know, all of us kids started doing stupid shit and falling apart and just fucking up and you know, and my Mom hasn’t really had the energy to chase my brothers, or my brother and my sister around at night you know, doesn’t have the energy to go to church, you know, she’ll either sleep all day on Sunday or you know clean the house as much as she can.","The respondent believes morality is relative and shaped by societal norms, but emphasizes the importance of treating others well based on the principle of ""do unto others,"" which he attributes to his upbringing and religious teachings from his mother, despite acknowledging his past mistakes like stealing.","I:How do you know what’s good and bad or right and wrong in life?

R:How do you know what’s right or wrong?
I:Yeah, how do you know? How do you make decisions like that?
R:I guess it depends on what it is...  And you try to decide what’s right or wrong. Like what?
I:So where do you think right and wrong comes from? Does it come from God, does it come from consequences, is there really a right and wrong? Or what?
R:I guess depends on who you are and what you think.
I:What about for you yourself?
R:I don’t know.  Uh, what was the last question?
I:What makes anything right or wrong anyway?  Where does morality even come from?
R:From the inside, I guess.
I:So when you say from the inside, do you mean a conscience or you just feel it?
R:There’s a voice inside. Says, don’t do that, or that’s not really so bad, you can do that.","How do you know what’s right or wrong? I guess it depends on what it is...

R:Usually, it's pretty easy.
I:Has it gotten easier or harder over the past few years?

R:I think it's like…

I:Okay.  Now um, do you think that if a person isn’t taught for example that like stealing is wrong or something like that, if they do it, it’s okay?
R:Well no it, I don’t know how to explain it, it’s just  um, that’s a hard question.  It’s…
I:Take your time.
R:It’s basically what the outcome of the action is.  If, if it’s gonna harm someone or if it’s um, you can just tell if it’s right or wrong, I don’t know how to explain it, but a lot of times you just can.
I:Okay.  Um, you gave the example of um, the example of like premarital sex for example, why is that wrong?
R:Um, my personal belief or?
I:Yeah, yeah.  Yeah your per—yeah your—
R:Or the school version?
I:No, your—
R:Um, cause I believe that you should wait ‘til you, um, wait ‘til you’re married and when just ‘til that, with that person.
I:Why, why is that important?  Like what’s the good, I mean, what’s the consequence of not doing that, I guess.
R:Um,  you could end up having problems like if you get pregnant or um, it just causes more tension between the people and it just, you know it’s.
I:Okay.  So what if um, what if two people let’s say were, like there was no danger of them getting pregnant, well if the girl getting pregnant and, and they thought that they could handle it and everything, would that still be okay?
R:Um, I, I think it still just causes tension between the two people.
I:What is it that causes the tension, do you think?
R:Um, I don’t know.
I:Okay.  Um, how do you know what is good and bad or right and wrong in life?

R:Um, what is, this inner feeling tells you what it is.  Um, if it’s right or not because you just get this instinct impression if you’re doing something right or not.
I:Um, and could you describe the impression for me, is that a physical feeling, spiritual, emotional.
R:It’s both, um, I guess it’s all of them, depending on the time.  Sometimes it’s more of um, physical and spiritual and sometimes it’s just a thought that comes into your head that you’re not expecting.
I:Okay, um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:A lot of times it’s the outcome.  Um, like, people say how drugs and alcohol, they have a bad influence and so eventually it will just, it’ll just show you that its wrong but, there’s other choices, just the small choices that you can tell will have a different impact or a not so good impact if you did that.

R:Um, health, social and personal.
I:Okay.

If you don’t…I like to talk in like general things, more than personal things, but if I don’t feel good about something or if I just feel not normal, I know it’s not right, but if it feels kind of paradoxical but it feels right and feels good then I know it’s something that I’m doing right.

I:Like what kinds of results would make something wrong?

I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Easier I think.
I:Why?
R:I spend like less time with my friends and less time with other people and focus on me and attending school so it’s like less peer pressure to do between right and wrong so it’s just do what I feel is right and wrong so it’s pretty precise so it’s become easier.
I:And have your views about what’s right and wrong changed over the past two years?
R:Yeah, I think so.
I:How?
R:Like I can see other people’s point of views better, so if I think something’s right or wrong, and they explain to me why they think it’s—if I say something’s right and when they say it’s wrong, they explain to me what they think, then I might be able to change my mind, stuff like that.
I:Are there any particular issues or ways in which you kind of changed your view between right and wrong?
R:Not really. But I’ve changed my view on religion a lot in the past year or so because other people was influenced and stuff like that. I’m a history major so, and a science major, so like you get to see religion from way back so you can see some differences in your mind so…
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I guess that’s more a personal opinion.
I:Personal opinion.
R:Yeah. I would say,  guilt, I don’t know.
I:So if it feels guilty…

R:If it’s hurting another person. I think it’s wrong.
I:From where do you think you acquired your moral views?
R:Probably from my grandfather.
I:Grandfather?
R:Yeah.
I:Any other places they come from?
R:My friends, from my friend’s families.","Try to think if my mom and my grandfather would approve of it. Just legality as a law. Yeah. And I have a really big guilty conscience, so if it’s going to cause me grief like a couple of years’ time… keep on thinking about them not to pursue anything like that. Not really. It’s pretty clear to me. Yeah. Easier I think. I spend like less time with my friends and less time with other people and focus on me and attending school so it’s like less peer pressure to do between right and wrong so it’s just do what I feel is right and wrong so it’s pretty precise so it’s become easier. Yeah, I think so. Like I can see other people’s point of views better, so if I think something’s right or wrong, and they explain to me why they think it’s—if I say something’s right and when they say it’s wrong, they explain to me what they think, then I might be able to change my mind, stuff like that. Not really. But I’ve changed my view on religion a lot in the past year or so because other people was influenced and stuff like that. I’m a history major so, and a science major, so like you get to see religion from way back so you can see some differences in your mind so…  I guess that’s more a personal opinion. Yeah. I would say,  guilt, I don’t know. If it feels guilty or… yeah. If it’s hurting another person. I think it’s wrong.  Probably from my grandfather. Yeah. My friends, from my friend’s families.","The respondent plans to use an inheritance of $100,000 primarily to pay for school and buy a new car due to financial concerns and the burden of a faulty vehicle, while their moral decision-making is influenced by the approval of their mother and grandfather, a strong guilty conscience, and a clearer understanding of right and wrong developed through reduced peer pressure and increased focus on personal values."

R:I go with my heart on that.
I:Okay, in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:At the time or later on?
I:At the time.
R:At the time of the decision it seems pretty easy, I just make my decision and I go with it.  Do I regret things I do sometimes?  Of course, but there’s no time to hesitate sometimes, you just have to do things.
I:Now when you say you go with your heart, what do you mean by that exactly?
R:I go with what I feel is necessary at the time.
I:Okay, does it, what does that feel, is there a particular feeling that’s associated with that?
R:I don’t know, it’s just uh, a feeling of that’s what needs to be done, that’s what’s right, that’s what you gotta do about it.
I:Okay um, has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:At, on the spur of the moment, easier.
I:Okay um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:That’s hard to say.  A lot of things man.  How it benefits you, it’s how it hurts other people, it’s every thing that happens because of what you do.  All the little side affects, how they all add up in the end.
I:Okay um, do you think that there are, so you’d say mainly it’s consequences then?
R:I wouldn’t call it consequences because I mean, when you say consequences people think like jail time or like laws but it’s like how it affects everything.
I:Okay what kinds of affects would make something wrong?
R:The sort of affects that like harm innocent people.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:I don’t believe in that.
I:Okay where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Aside from my parents, like my, definitely mostly my parents.  Mostly my parents but a lot of what I see day to day in the street and everything else affects it.","I go with my heart on that.

R:Well, if it’s a personal, private decision, I go by what I feel.  If it’s something that, like a workplace decision, I normally go by what I think my higher ups morals and values are.
I:Can you give me an example?
R:Hmm.  Well, yeah.  Let’s say like at my most recent job, let’s say I’m out and about doing my sales thing, like running inquiries and people who I’ve given them estimates and I come to a house that asks for me to come up with an estimate and they already have an estimate on their door from another company doing the same thing.  Now, normally, honestly, I would, even though I have loose morals, I would never just leave that there, because they’re gonna get the quote either way, but I know my boss is all about taking those things, he likes to look at them, he likes to see, because like, he’ll have a yellow copy of my estimate, he likes to compare our estimates to theirs, see how they stack up and he’d rather the potential customer never even saw the other person’s estimate.  So in that situation, I’ll just grab it because I know he’s gonna be like oh, good job, when I give it to him, and it’s gonna get me ahead a little bit, so.
I:Gotcha, okay.  And so that’s a routine practice for you?
R:Well I mean, if he discouraged it, I wouldn’t do it.  But because he encourages it, I do it.
I:Okay, because you think it’ll help you in the company, right?  Okay.  In general, how easy or hard would you say it is for you to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:Pretty easy.
I:Has it gotten, do you think it’s, since the last time we talked to you, do you think it’s gotten easier or harder, stayed about the same?
R:Always harder.
I:Really?
R:Always harder.
I:How so?
R:The older you get, the more your decisions affect other people.  I mean, when I was young and single, it was just me.  And now I got to worry about my girlfriend.
I:But generally would you say it’s pretty easy or harder to choose what you know is right.
R:It’s fairly easy.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think that’s all about how you were raised.  I mean, morals are, they’re so, I mean people tell you they’re not subjective but they are.  Someone who is raised in institutions their whole life has a whole different set of morality than someone who was raised in like a Mormon or one of the very religious backgrounds.  Yeah, totally different morals.  Now that’s because the guy was raised in institutions his whole life is even worse,  but it’s just what he was taught when he was young.
I:And what do you think, do you think there’s like, but do you think like, let’s say these two people they disagree about what’s right and wrong.  Is one of them closer to right than the other one?  And, if so, how?  Why?
R:Well, generally, you have to go by the group consensus, so sure one of them’s got to be closer to right because when we, what the general population views is right is sort of the general consensus.  I mean, there was once a time when people thought it was right to throw two people in the arena and ____________  to death.  That was seemed generally okay.  That’s not anymore.  You’d never get away with that now.
I:Do you think it was right then, though?  Like do you think it was right or wrong?
R:For me from now, no?  If me grew up back then, I’d think it was fine.
I:But who would have been right?
R:I don’t know, is anybody even right?  I mean, that’s the real question, I’d probably be right.  Is it a sin if nobody believes it’s a sin?
I:And what about, where do you think your own views of right and wrong come from?
R:My own views of right and wrong I think come from a combination of how I was raised and what I see when I was growing up, things that experienced.
I:Like anything stick out in particular?
R:Well, you know, met quite a few people with a lot of money who really don’t have any morals at all.  I think that sort of affects me a little bit.
I:Really?  How’s that?
R:Because if you look around the real genuinely, genuinely nice, great people--not doing that good.
I:Okay.
R:I mean, know what a Vice Presidents of major corporations run by someone without skeletons in their closet.

R:Um, I mostly, I almost always fall back on my religion.  It’s like there’s values for everything and structure and just things to fall back on, it’s just, it’s, it’s a good thing.
I:Okay, could you give me some specific examples of things?
R:Um, I guess like the word of wisdom, for example, where you can’t have alcohol and you can’t have hot drinks like tea or coffee or whatever and, and, just drugs in general and things like that, and even just, even overdosing on a, on a over the counter prescription drug.  Just things like that, I was on a, actually I went on a, I went on a cruise to the Caribbean for Spring Break and there was a, I sort of had a weird feeling, like I was down there, I should have known, but um, I was down in a, it was a club for 18 and older from, it was from like 10:30 ‘til like 4 in the morning or something or, whenever it fizzled out, but I was down there and it was like, I think it was like midnight or something but they were passing out jell-o and everyone was like oh jell-o shooters and I was like oh, jell-o okay, but I like, I didn’t know it was alcoholic but I had a friend that she was eating them and everything but I was actually, um, was talking to her about my religion and I actually gave her a book of Mormon, but I put the straw to my mouth and I started sucking, she’s like there’s alcohol in that, and I was like oh, so I was like this close to having alcohol, but, so I was cutting it close and I’ll need to watch out for that, but that’s, I think that’s probably the closest that I’ve ever come to having, to having anything that goes against my standards.","Um, my religion, mostly. Um, I think it’s your own opinion but I guess there are things I guess in your religion and other things that you’ve been taught just in general in your life that would back that up, whether it was right or wrong. Um, some people’s I guess some people’s opinions can, certain people’s opinions I guess can back up, back up things, they may have things that would back it up in a certain way and other people may have their opinion that would back up certain things in another way, you know that same thing in another way and make it look different. Um, maybe for that person if that’s their opinion than yeah I guess that, I guess that’s, that’s their choice, I guess, but. Um, I think that’s another opinion issue, just, it’s just like their own personal opinion, in my opinion it’s totally wrong, but that’s, that’s my opinion, that’s my two bits.

R:It depends on the majority of the time I just go by what I have been taught and how I have been raised and there are a lot of decisions I just decided a long time ago and they haven’t been a problem, like smoking and drinking.  I never even think about it.  I just like no, I just don’t do it.
I:Do you feel like it is easy or hard for you to decide what’s right or wrong?
R:With reference to?
I:Just in general.  Do you have a hard time knowing what is right or wrong?
R:I think that all depends on the situation at least in my case.
I:Like what we are trying to get at I guess is what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  What is the criteria there?  Like do you think it is rules or laws, consequences, how it feels?
R:I think how it feels.
I:Ok, so it is more internal.
R:Yes, I mean I think somebody should make decisions that are correct based on intrinsic factors rather than external.  The inside rather than being influenced by outside sources to do something right.
I:Well that sort of falls in line with this, but…
R:Like one quote that I heard is integrity is making the right decision when nobody else is watching.","It depends on the majority of the time I just go by what I have been taught and how I have been raised and there are a lot of decisions I just decided a long time ago and they haven’t been a problem, like smoking and drinking.

So where do you think your own views of right and wrong come from?
R:Um, some come from influence from my friends and family.  Other just seem to like, come out of the sky
I:Okay.  What do you think it takes to make something right or wrong? Like what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:I really wouldn’t know.
I:Okay, let’s see.  We kind of covered this some, but how do you decide or know what’s good or bad or right or wrong in life in general?
R:Um, well like I said before, well with like the conscience and all, um if something just feels like it’s really out of place and sometimes I’d consider it wrong.
I:Is that emotionally out of place, or
R:It could be emotionally out of place, or also, if something just seems weird to me, it’s not like, regular, then.
I:Okay.  Let’s see, so would you say that you strive to keep a level of normality in your life when it comes to making decisions about what’s right and wrong?
R:At times, yes I will.  Um, sometimes I’ll feel like really conscience about myself thinking, people are going to think I’m really weird, so I try to act, it’s like, what I consider to be normal.
I:Okay.  Do you know what might influence that?
R:I don’t know, maybe, I just think I’m afraid people are going to think that I’m crazy or something.
I:Okay.  Let’s see, can you tell me why you think that would be bad?
R:Um, well, some, I just don’t like the feeling that people are going to be looking at me and saying “oh look at that girl, she’s…crazy.” (Giggles)
I:So do you think that what most people think is normal is, could be considered right, and what people would consider really abnormal would be something you’d considered wrong?
R:Sometimes, um, what some people consider abnormal, I could use an example of a boy from my school.  Um, I’m, I’m not sure if I’d consider him wrong, but he’s…scary.  And a lot of people consider him abnormal. But some of the things that he does are not, right.
I:Okay.  Can you think of things in a situation, say if something were abnormal, can you think of something that might be abnormally, abnormal socially, but still right, morally right?
R:Um, (pause), I don’t know, I’m thinking of like, examples.
I:Take your time.
R:It could be, um, abnormal socially, but it could be pretty much right. Um, maybe, I’m not sure if this would be a good example, but like, um, going and helping people that are like sick and have like, um, really bad diseases, a lot of people think that that’s just like disgusting, you don’t want to go near people that are all like, dirty and diseased, but then it’s morally right, because it’s nice to help somebody.
I:What about being religious, do you think that being religious is viewed as kind of right or wrong, or socially normal or abnormal?
R:No. I think that people can be whatever religion that they want, cause it really doesn’t matter.
I:Okay, so that doesn’t fall into the kind of right and wrong?
R:No.","Um, some come from influence from my friends and family.  Other just seem to like, come out of the sky I really wouldn’t know.

No.","The respondent makes decisions primarily based on their conscience and instinct, often seeking advice from friends and parents, while feeling guilt over actions like skipping class due to a strong sense of right and wrong influenced by societal norms and personal beliefs.","I:Okay.  Alright.  So, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Oh, well there’s always that inner voice that tells me if something’s wrong or right.
I:Where do you think that inner voice comes from?  Can you kind of describe?
R:Uh, I’m not really sure.
I:What it is or you’re not sure?
R:Uh, probably just from things I’ve learned just through life.  From parents, from friends and teachers and all that.  All those things combined together, telling me what’s right and what’s wrong.  Like for example, I don’t need an inner voice to tell me about things like drugs and alcohol, because I just know about my life, that’s bad.  Um, and then other things, like cheating or stealing, I think that’s pretty much the same thing, where all throughout my life I’ve been told and so I just remember that.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Usually it’s pretty easy.
I:Has it gotten more difficult over the past 2 years?
R:Not really.  But, yeah, I don’t think so.  If anything it might have actually been a little bit easier.  Because before I would have had some trouble in those decisions, and then I’m not sure what changed, but things started becoming so much more obvious to me.  Like before I was you know, I remember friends telling me, well everyone drinks in college, so I was like oh, well maybe I will drink a little bit before 21, and then I was like no way, I’m not going to do that.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Uh, I’m not really sure.  How much it hurts others, in accordance to how much it helps you.  Not in accordance, I don’t know where that word came from, um, just you know, if it hurts somebody a lot, and if it helps you quite a bit, then it’s probably not the best to do.  I try my best to do something that wont hurt someone else, like drastically, I mean, I’m trying to think, winning a game or something like that, it’s not that I’m going to go easy on someone playing some sort of sport just so that um, I can help them feel better, cause once again I have that competitive streak.
I:Do you have a sense where you draw a line?
R:Yeah, I mean, if I’m playing against a beginner, I don’t play it anymore, but when I used to play tennis against a beginner and I could see them feeling completely miserable every time they missed a shot, then I would go a little more easy on them.  But I’m not nice enough to completely sacrifice my game to let them win.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Um, well in my opinion, doing drugs, stealing and killing people.
I:What do you think these things have in common that makes them wrong?
R:I’m not sure, um, probably, well killing people you know, I just find that really bad, unless it’s something in self defense, I understand that, but if you just go to someone and you dislike them and kill them or hurt them really badly, that’s just wrong, cause it’s like, I don’t know, I just don’t think that it’s right.  Um, I’ve never been asked actually what makes that wrong.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:A lot of it probably comes from you know, school and always being told, alcohol’s bad, and hey there’s Ryan* um, and certain things like that.  Yeah.","Oh, well there’s always that inner voice that tells me if something’s wrong or right. Uh, I’m not really sure. Uh, probably just from things I’ve learned just through life.

R:I don’t know, intuition sort of.  I mean I use judgment with everything like – I don’t know, it just kinda comes naturally.  Like I can’t think of anything that really like actively influences me to decide what’s right or wrong, or good or bad.  Maybe it’s just sort of how I’ve developed as a person that kinda helps things like that along.
I:And in general is it easier or harder for you do decide between right and wrong?
R:Usually not, usually the wrong choice kinda glares at me like, “No!  Wrong!”  Although like relationship wise I have a really bad time deciding like what’s right and wrong in that case.  I’m – because I’m just terrible at it.  But other than that usually like if I’m in a situation where I feel like it’s – I’m doing something wrong, then usually I get really uncomfortable with it and I just back out.
I:So do you think that deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder over the last couple years?
R:I don’t think there’s really been much of a change.  My definitions of right and wrong have changed, but with the ease of deciding between them, I don’t really think there’s much of a difference.
I:And you said that your views have changed?
R:Yeah.  Like I used to be total straightedge and I felt like pretty much everything was bad.  Like – I don’t know – everything that like any normal college kid does is like, “Well, that’s bad!  You shouldn’t do that.”  And now I just don’t care and like your entitled to do what you want just try and at least take care of yourself, and just try and like make good decisions for yourself and for the people around you.  Don’t get yourself into kind of a pit where you either you don’t – cant’ get out yourself, you drag other people in, that sorta thing.  That’s pretty much it.
I:So what do you think makes something right or wrong?  Is it like a consequence, or a feeling, or –
R:I don’t know.
I:How do you decide?
R:It’s usually just kind of a gut feeling sort of like based on morals and all that sorta thing.  It’s like – I don’t know – it’s like ethics, sort of.  Like for example, like he would consider – well, I can’t even think a good example. I was gonna go down the path of like science or something like that, but I don’t remember what I was gonna say.  But in any case, it is just sort of like a gut feeling sort of dealing with like – just sort of like principal ethics of society like – I mean you can’t like say killing people is right.  Well, I mean like just in cold blood, killing someone, you can’t like – there are pretty much no ethics anywhere that say that’s the right thing to do, just shooting someone for the fun of it, but yeah.  I don’t know – like there are certain things that are like right or wrong based on the individual.  Sort of – so sort of like how your life was shaped, like what you grew up in, and just sorta your view of society as a whole, your whole like morals and set of ethics and standards and everything like that.  But there are certain things that are just right and wrong like based on society that’s sort of – I don’t really know how to explain where it comes from, it’s just sort of innate, you know?  Like for example, killing someone in cold blood, that’s just wrong.  And I don’t really know where that comes from, like who was the original person to say that, it’s just something that’s always been there.  Do you know what I mean?
I:Yeah.  But so if it’s kind of an innate gut feeling, what happens if people’s feeling tells them something different?
R:I don’t know, honestly I don’t.  Like is it something that’s just – it’s hard to understand. Like I’ve never really completely the concept of like right and wrong and where it comes from.  I just know that like there are certain sets that everyone – most everyone – seems to follow.  And it’s a really hard thing to decide sort of as a general society like sort thing.  Like I honestly don’t know like where it came from, how it started, and what it really is – right and wrong.  I don’t know.  It’s weird.
I:So where do you think you’ve acquired your moral views from?
R:I don’t know.  That’s something I’ve asked myself a lot. I have no idea where I ever came up with the idea of like atheism, or where I came up with like just a lot of my like views of right and wrong.  I – because a lot of like views that I have now they like right and wrong switches views entirely. I have never heard anybody else that has anything like it, and I just – I don’t know where it came from.  Like just kinda things that I thought up that I decided was right for me.  So I don’t know.

Like is it something that’s just – it’s hard to understand. Like I’ve never really completely the concept of like right and wrong and where it comes from.  I just know that like there are certain sets that everyone – most everyone – seems to follow.  And it’s a really hard thing to decide sort of as a general society like sort thing.  Like I honestly don’t know like where it came from, how it started, and what it really is – right and wrong.  I don’t know.  It’s weird.  I don’t know.  That’s something I’ve asked myself a lot. I have no idea where I ever came up with the idea of like atheism, or where I came up with like just a lot of my like views of right and wrong.  I – because a lot of like views that I have now they like right and wrong switches views entirely. I have never heard anybody else that has anything like it, and I just – I don’t know where it came from.  Like just kinda things that I thought up that I decided was right for me.  So I don’t know.  I honestly don’t.  It just kinda came outa thin air.","The respondent primarily relies on intuition and personal judgment to determine right from wrong, acknowledges the difficulty of making decisions that prioritize their own happiness over others' feelings, and expresses a desire for greater compassion and understanding in the world, while also admitting to feeling superior to those they perceive as less intelligent."

R:Well you know, just sometimes you don’t think something is wrong until you face it.  And then when you face it, then you say, oh shoot it’s wrong, you know, I shouldn’t be doing this.  And sometimes you know when it’s wrong but you still go and do it.  Yeah, so.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Well, uh, it’s like, say example, you supposed to be going to school and you say I’m going to be going with my boyfriend.  And I’d say that’s wrong, and you know, it depends on you if you want to do the wrong or if you want to do the right, you know.
I:Do you think that’s easy or hard for you?
R:It’s real easy for me.  If it was in New York*, that’s so easy for me.  But Georgia* it’s hard, you know, you got to drive everywhere.
I:So how easy or hard is it for you to decide between what’s right and wrong?
R:Like, I had to uh, example, example, is and like, um, uh, for like an example, like, like last week I was supposed to be going out and I had some other, I had to tell my mother I was going out with some friends, but I was really going out, and you know, it was wrong you know, but I wanted to get out of the house, but you know, afterwards when I sit down and think about it, I said that’s the wrong thing to do, you know, you’re lying, and so.
I:So, has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Easier.
I:Easier?  In what way?
R:Always tell the truth.  Always tell the truth.
I:Does doing the right thing come naturally or is it hard?
R:Come naturally.  Naturally.
I:So has that changed at all over the last couple of years?
R:Yeah.
I:Why do you think that is?
R:Cause it’s not worth it.  You know, telling the truth is the right thing you know?  Cause if you lie long enough your parents are going to know, so.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:What it is?
I:Yeah, what makes something right or wrong?
R:You just, like if you know that it’s not a good, if you know that it’s not a good um, a good thing to do, it don’t make no sense to you, you know, if you know it’s good then you know you made the right choice. Like for me an example, the boyfriend, I don’t think I’m making a right choice because I, you know, I was making the right choice, but you know, it’s a hard thing.
I:So what about a situation, or what about meeting a boy or something like that, makes you know whether it’s right or wrong?
R:Well you know, first time, first time you can’t say something, um, you meet the guy and you think he’s the right one. And then you start going out and he’s being nice and everything, and you say “oh mom, look at this guy.”  But my mom knows if a person’s right for me or not.
I:What about things that are right and wrong to do?
R:What?
I:What about things that are right and wrong to do?  Like what makes something that you do, good or bad, or right or wrong.
R:Um, I’d just say, you know, you know if I do a good thing, you know I be so proud of myself.  But when you do a bad thing, you feel, you feel good, but then afterward, later on, you feel so guilty.  So you just got to make the right choice.
I:So what kind of feelings do you think indicate what’s right and wrong?
R:You’ll know my feelings, cause I’ll start crying.  There’s that, and you’ll just see a big smile on my face if I’ve done something good.
I:Okay.  And where do you think those feelings come from?
R:If it good?
I:Uh-huh.
R:If someone does something real bad to me, or if I do something real bad, yeah I think that’s where I get that bad feeling.  But if I’ve been doing good, been volunteering what I’m supposed to be doing, that’s a good thing.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong?
R:No.
I:No?  Why do you think that?
R:Because, I’m never wrong.  I mean these few years I’ve never done nothing wrong that I’m not supposed to be doing, so I think it’s nothing you know.
I:What about things in general that people do?  Are there any things that people do that are just wrong always?
R:Yeah, having kids.  That’s wrong.  That’s right but that’s wrong.  If you’re not married, that’s wrong.
I:Can you think of any other examples?
R:Pregnant.  You got to get married to get pregnant.  Doing drugs.
I:Can you think of any things that people do that are always right?
R:Go to school.  Just try to get an education.  Wait until you’re married to have some kids.  Um, that’s the best choice, you know.  Um, um, yeah, just trying to find the right person.

R:Well, I think about what, it’s like if, if I were doing something, when anything that I think of is, well, it’s like when my grandmother or my mother, would they be happy? If someone were to hear, oh, would say, “oh I heard Matthew* did this”, would they be happy if they heard that? Or would they be, would they be disappointed? And pretty much just the morals, and what my mother taught me from childhood till now. And then just a little, and then what, from my own experience, from the situation. Well, that’s what I do.
I:In general, would you say it’s easy or hard to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy to decide.
I:Has deciding between wrong, right and wrong gotten harder or easier over the past two years?
R:It’s gotten, it’s gotten easier since, over time. Because now I just, I, don’t know. Some people look at it, well when you’re younger, you can maybe get away with it, I wanna say. Not exactly get away with it, but maybe the punishment might not be as severe because of your age. But now that I’m older, it’s, it’s just hit or miss. If you do something, it’s like, I don’t know what there may be, but if it’s wrong, that could end your life right there, or your goals, or what you’re pursuing for. So, it’s gotten a lot easier to know what’s right and wrong because, this is right, this is wrong, look at all the consequences. If I do this, if I do that, I could, all of this could happen and everything I worked up to to this point will be gone. So, it’s gotten easier to decide, to distinguish between the two.
I:Have your views changed in the past couple of years?
R:No, they’ve pretty much stayed, remained the same.
I:Why would you, how would you say it remained the same? Or why have they remained the same?
R:Well, it depends on what it is. I don’t know.
I:Are you thinking of like a specific?
R:Like, I don’t know. Like you said have your views over
I:Yeah, like, like moral views.
R:Oh, moral. Yeah, they’ve stayed the same. I don’t know, they haven’t changed, because I’m not really sure why.
I:So, for you, it’s gotten, is it, has it gotten easier? I mean, is it pretty easy for you to choose right or wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:The, the action, like the cause and effect. So, I guess, whatever the affect is of what your actions, or what happens, or what you’ve done. I think that determines what’s right and wrong.
I:So what kind of effects would make something wrong?
R:Well, a main one which happened a lot on camp, well not happened a lot but it was often heard of, people drinking and driving. People, in the dorms, not as much as the one that I stayed in, but other ones, people getting caught drinking under the age. And then they have it where, if you do it like, I think it’s three strikes or something, and you’ll be kicked out of your residential hall, your dorm room. And so, obviously that was wrong, because then you won’t have anywhere to live, and it’s on your record and stuff, so.
I:So the consequences? Getting kicked out?
R:Yeah, the consequences.
I:From where, from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:From my grandmother and my, my mother.
I:I mean, how so? I mean, how did they, how do you think they were sort of influence?
R:Through, oh, through experience. Just while, while growing up. Like, just, strong, also when I lied. Like, if I lied when I was growing up, even if it was a small one, they always got on me. Like, they were really strict about that, because they said that lying, like lying, you just shouldn’t do it in general. And because lying leads into other things, and then the more you lie, the more you have to, you know, fix yourself, tell another lie. And then, in one sense, if you’re lying, depending on the situation, you could get in more trouble. It could lead into stealing, killing, et cetera. So, you’re kinda off to a wrong, like headed towards a wrong path of life, by constantly lying. So, so I guess that’s one of the main ones , was to always be honest.","Well, I think about what, it’s like if, if I were doing something, when anything that I think of is, well, it’s like when my grandmother or my mother, would they be happy? If someone were to hear, oh, would say, “oh I heard Matthew* did this”, would they be happy if they heard that? Or would they be, would they be disappointed? And pretty much just the morals, and what my mother taught me from childhood till now. And then just a little, and then what, from my own experience, from the situation. Well, that’s what I do. It’s easy to decide. It’s gotten, it’s gotten easier since, over time. Because now I just, I, don’t know. Some people look at it, well when you’re younger, you can maybe get away with it, I wanna say. Not exactly get away with it, but maybe the punishment might not be as severe because of your age. But now that I’m older, it’s, it’s just hit or miss. If you do something, it’s like, I don’t know what there may be, but if it’s wrong, that could end your life right there, or your goals, or what you’re pursuing for. So, it’s gotten a lot easier to know what’s right and wrong because, this is right, this is wrong, look at all the consequences. If I do this, if I do that, I could, all of this could happen and everything I worked up to to this point will be gone. So, it’s gotten easier to decide, to distinguish between the two. No, they’ve pretty much stayed, remained the same. Well, it depends on what it is. I don’t know. Like, I don’t know. Like you said have your views over Oh, moral. Yeah, they’ve stayed the same. I don’t know, they haven’t changed, because I’m not really sure why. Yeah.  The, the action, like the cause and effect. So, I guess, whatever the affect is of what your actions, or what happens, or what you’ve done. I think that determines what’s right and wrong.

R:Probably from the Bible actually, like what Jesus did.  I mean how can you argue with God?  There’s no arguing right there, so.
I:Okay.  And I know it’s hard to pinpoint it but what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Like what inherently about it?
R:Um pretty much your morals, uh whatever you believe in.  Like you can’t say like, maybe I’ll think this is right and the guy next to me, well he thinks it’s totally wrong, I mean it’s your own beliefs and your own opinions.
I:How do you decide or know, I mean you mentioned the Bible, is that they way you know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?

Um, how do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Um, I think the old golden rule applies. Whether or not ah like would you want that done to you. Like  is that a good decision. You always think you know, you had that conscience and you’re like man should I be doing this? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? So.
I:Ok. In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong in life?
R:Depends. It’s situational. I mean usually it’s just like yea it’s stupid, don’t do it, you know. Sometimes there’s some things you’re like man should I do this right now and you’re just like ah screw it, whatever, I don’t care, I’ll do it. It’s pretty, it’s pretty cut and dry.
I:Right. Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:I think easier. I mean you become more focused, especially you know this close to graduation.

I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think your beliefs. I mean what you feel. It’s a gut instinct, you know, um. What might be right for me might be completely wrong for the guy next door to me, so.
I:So where do those instincts come from?
R:I don’t know if you want me to say it’s like biologically ingrained in you or you know it’s part of your environment, but I think it’s both.

R:well what I could give them is I guess my own principles which I go on, which are sometimes unclear even to me at times, but usually right and wrong I decide by harming others, giving I guess, benefiting where benefit needs to be given like in this case my mom could really use the money towards her medical bills a lot more than I could use a new car. I have a car, it’s fine. So I guess, I don’t know sometimes I wonder about my own moral conscience at times but, just what seems right to me is…there’s always usually something that’s like that just seems like the right thing to do, it’s hard for me to explain, I think it’s just a general fundamental situation that you know, if you do this and there’s harm to be done here then you just have to weigh it out and I guess just weight out the harm and the benefit and I, I just think not hurting other people unnecessarily is one of the main factors that…
I:has deciding on right or wrong, has it become harder or easier over the last couple of years?
R:um, hmmm. I think it might have become harder, I think it’s become harder because there’s so many decisions that I make that I don’t stop and think you know is this right or wrong. But then again, there’s a lot, I mean that might be because I’m doing a lot, I’m doing fewer things, I’m more busy with school, I’m doing fewer things that that decision needs to be made with. But I think that living on my own stuff, things just come, I just do things based on instinct and what I, I just…this feels like the right thing to do, I just make the decision. So I don’t know if it’s become more difficult, but I find myself stopping to consider it a lot less than I did. I trust my judgment a lot more.
I:wow, alright. Is there anything you would say makes things right or wrong, that you would point to and say, this makes it right or wrong?
R:I think the overall situation, like I said before, if something creates more harm in one area, to create a little bit of benefit in another area, I think you have to consider the whole benefit, so I think just the balance, if something creates more of a negative balance whatever that may be, then I think that would be more likely to be wrong than right and vice versa. So I think the consequences of an action, all told, are what would most make the decision of if it’s right or wrong.
I:and is there any way of talking about the relative importance of different kinds of consequences?
R:oh yeah, certainly. I think if family is involved versus, I mean if it would’ve been*Indian*or a family member, obviously the focus would have been more on my family. Family or I guess grander things that affect many more people, obviously, are relatively more important when considering the overall consequences of an action. So yeah, I think you have to consider the relative importance of everything.
I:any actions that you would say are wrong in themselves?
R:um…hmmm. I think any action that is just fundamentally wrong, regardless of the circumstance, I think physically hurting women, that pops into my brain first as like, the situation would have to be a pretty unique situation for me to see that as being an acceptable thing to do, like physically hurting women and children.
I:and that in particular is because of the power dynamics there?
R:um, maybe, maybe just because society says that you know, you’re not supposed to hit women and children, but yeah, I just think basically because they’re usually viewed as being more defenseless. I mean I don’t, I mean if you have, I think the reasons for hitting another man can be, you can have a lot less reasons to do that than to hit a woman or a child. Hurting family members, you know physically or not, I think is hard to justify in my mind. Being malicious about things that you have no reason to be malicious about you know, just for the fact of being violent or rude, I think you know, basically things that have no reason, no motivation behind violence or evilness I guess, those sort of things I see as…
I:and then if, okay so, that’s interesting how you put it about having an outside structure that tells you right and wrong and so, where would you say that your understandings of right and wrong come from?
R:because I don’t have an outside structure, I’d say they come from observations, experience, past experience, so I guess when I’m making decisions of right or wrong, instead of looking to a religious framework or some other framework set up outside, I look to my own past experience, my own decisions I’ve made before, what was my mindset when I made that decision, do I trust my own instinct in that case to apply it here again. So just sort of reflection on my own past decisions, observations on what my parents have done, what other people have done, observing those consequences.","well what I could give them is I guess my own principles which I go on, which are sometimes unclear even to me at times, but usually right and wrong I decide by harming others, giving I guess, benefiting where benefit needs to be given like in this case my mom could really use the money towards her medical bills a lot more than I could use a new car.

Family or I guess grander things that affect many more people, obviously, are relatively more important when considering the overall consequences of an action. So yeah, I think you have to consider the relative importance of everything. um…hmmm. I think any action that is just fundamentally wrong, regardless of the circumstance, I think physically hurting women, that pops into my brain first as like, the situation would have to be a pretty unique situation for me to see that as being an acceptable thing to do, like physically hurting women and children. um, maybe, maybe just because society says that you know, you’re not supposed to hit women and children, but yeah, I just think basically because they’re usually viewed as being more defenseless. I mean I don’t, I mean if you have, I think the reasons for hitting another man can be, you can have a lot less reasons to do that than to hit a woman or a child. Hurting family members, you know physically or not, I think is hard to justify in my mind. Being malicious about things that you have no reason to be malicious about you know, just for the fact of being violent or rude, I think you know, basically things that have no reason, no motivation behind violence or evilness I guess, those sort of things I see as…  because I don’t have an outside structure, I’d say they come from observations, experience, past experience, so I guess when I’m making decisions of right or wrong, instead of looking to a religious framework or some other framework set up outside, I look to my own past experience, my own decisions I’ve made before, what was my mindset when I made that decision, do I trust my own instinct in that case to apply it here again. So just sort of reflection on my own past decisions, observations on what my parents have done, what other people have done, observing those consequences.","The respondent would use the $100,000 to pay for their education and their mother's medical expenses, motivated by a desire to alleviate their mother's financial struggles, and they believe that right and wrong are determined by the potential harm to others, reflecting on their own experiences and the influence of their parents, while also expressing a struggle with moral decisions in complex situations, such as caring for a friend's well-being versus the potential consequences of seeking medical help.","I:How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong?
R:Normally, that’s hard to say.  I think usually I go by past experience.  My own past experience and just think, have I been in this situation before, what was it like, could I do it different this time or not?  If it’s something sort of amoral I’ll think about whatever my Dad would do probably.  Something sort of practical.  Something moral, I would still probably first think about, not necessarily what would my Dad do but what would my Dad think about what I did.  And disappointing my Mom is another thing that I’m always trying to avoid doing.  So if I’m faced with a decision, I think well if I make this choice, would I want my Mom to find out about it or not and a lot of times that’s like the low water mark for like depraved action, you know what I mean?  It’s like, if I would never want my Mom to find out about this, then I’ll probably rethink doing it.
I:Would you say it’s easy or hard for you to decide?
R:It’s usually easy because the decision itself, like isn’t always, I’m never really cognizant of the decision, you know what I mean?  I sort of tend to just live and react and sort of trust that I know what I’m doing, even though I really don’t think I do, I guess.  But I’m gonna say it’s easy just because I never like stop and think about that kind of decision very often.
I:Has that gotten, has that changed at all in the last 2 years?  Has it gotten easier or harder?
R:No, I don’t think, I don’t think that’s changed at all, I think.
I:And your standards of right and wrong, would you say that’s changed in the last couple years?
R:Yeah, if it has changed, my, it’s become a little, what’s right and what’s wrong has become a little bit more rigorous I think from just maturing through college and taking classes like when I have to think about children and things like that and every time I encounter people I’m always sort of, the past experience and things I talked about was always sort of revised, so I think it’s just, it becomes more honed as I get older.  I’m finding that to be the case.  Where like, before I would be like well I’m not really sure what I think about this, I kind of think this way now, now I’m more able I think so think about the reasons why I think something and stand behind it, I’m a little less wishy-washy.
I:Okay.  What do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:Hmm.  .  I don’t know.  I don’t agree with, I don’t think I agree with Hagle or Kant how to determine whether something is right or wrong, but I don’t—oh.  That’s such a difficult question.  I don’t know if there is any way to determine if something is right or wrong, I guess.  I mean, I think that’s the way I feel about it.
I:Where would you say you’ve acquired your moral views?
R:Oh, anywhere and everywhere, I guess.  My parents didn’t try to like present and drive home a set set of morals or values to me.  They’ve sort of demonstrated them to me and let me pick them up as I go and a lot of it has come from outside the family, just experience, things I’ve read, things I’ve listened to, things I’ve watched, causes I’ve taken.  It’s hard to put your finger on the part of that that was with you from the beginning, I think but you’ve always had, because it’s always changing and it’s hard to point to the things that have changed but I think that for me that’s something that’s always sort of being added to and evolving just as I live my life, I guess.","Normally, that’s hard to say.

I:Right, right, right, right.
R:So that plays a big part in it and I wanted freedom and they wouldn’t give it to me and um, I guess I kind of learned from myself what’s right and what’s wrong these days, but if, I don’t know, if, if you look back, I know my mom and dad kind of adopted that for me.  So.
I:Right.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Or what’s the criteria that you would say something is right or wrong?

I:Right.  Cause one of the things you mentioned is making fun of people.
R:Yeah.
I:And as far as I know there’s not a law against that, so what would make that wrong I guess?
R:Um, I think religiously it’s not a very nice thing to do and um, I don’t know, like it’s never, it’s not in the Bible or anything, but it just comes down to respect, and respecting people, definitely, just, I don’t know you don’t need to do that and it’s just bad for you, you know?

I:Can you give me an example of something other than taking your mom or dad’s car in the middle of the night?
R:Um,
I:Something recently where you’ve had to do that.  And whether you chose, whatever you chose, it doesn’t matter but you just think oh geeze here’s a consequence that I might not want to have to deal with or that I’m willing to deal with.

I:Okay, that’s fine, if you think of something.
R:Okay.","Um, my parents, I guess religious beliefs basically. Yeah. Yeah. If it’s gonna, the consequences of it I think.  Like if it’s going to be that, or is it going to be a positive thing in my life.  So is it going to help me make my life better or easier or is it going to get me in trouble where you know, I’m going to be grounded or with the law or, those things. Oh you can tell, like if I take the car in the middle of the night, that’s going to be bad if I get caught, you know, or if I just leave it there and call for a ride, and one’s going to be easier where I won’t have to worry about what might happen and one is where I will have to be on the lookout and keep my guard up so.

R:Your morals.
I:So what about the, so
R:The way you were brought up, how you were taught as a kid, your lifestyle.
I:Okay, so when you said you decide that you know right and wrong based on your gut, that's based on what you've been taught throughout your life.  Is that related to anything else like rules, laws, consequences, or how something feels, or –
R:The law is a big thing, because you never want to get in trouble with the law, you know what I mean?  So that’s a big thing.  Right or wrong is basically, yeah –

I:there some grey areas as well do you think?
R:I think they’re all absolute, the Ten Commandments, and yeah
I:Are those things that you have in mind when you’re making decisions on what do to as well?
R:Yeah, yeah.
I:Uhm, lets see, and are there some actions-well you said that the Ten Commandments are pretty fixed in stone, um, every-each one of those ten is always wrong to do one of those things considered wrong?
R:Right.
I:Okay.  Are there other things that are wrong inherently?
R:Probably everything the government just set up for us.  And the Ten Commandments says to follow those too—to follow your authority figures.
I:Okay.  Gotcha.  So, uhm, so your basis for what is right and wrong is the Ten Commandments plus the laws that the government has set up?
R:Yeah.  Cause it says in the Ten Commandments to follow what your authority has set for you too, so.
I:Would there be other things that you would use to determine right and wrong in addition to those things?

R:Most of it’s a gut feeling, and then, just in the way I’ve been brought up, and it all makes sense to me. I think about it and it makes sense. I think when you’re younger it’s  you’re influenced by your parents. And then when you get older you can kinda think about it in your own head, make sense of it. And I’ve thought about it, and a lot of it makes sense to me.

R:It’s pretty easy.
I:And has this gotten easier or harder, you’d say, in the last couple years?

I:Any reason why?
R:I think just because I’ve grown up and I can understand things a lot better than when I was younger.
I:Have your views changed in any way in the last couple years?
R:Not really, no.
I:You’d just things are a lot clearer, but they’re not different?
R:Right, yeah.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it’s all the way I believe it and the way that the society looks at it, too.
I:Like some things are right or wrong depending on whether your society says it’s right or wrong?
R:Kinda like the peer pressure thing.
I:I mean, is it wrong because your, I don’t know, your friends say it’s wrong, or because…
R:And the things I believe in. That, too.
I:Why do you believe those things?
R:I think it’s kind of just a sense of hope and things like that. Like my religion, I believe in what I believe in because I know I’m saved when I die.
I:Some people say it’s consequences of your actions that make something like wrong as opposed to being good for a lot of people. Or people say, no it’s what you feel, if you feel it’s right, then it’s right, regardless of what people tell you. So what do you think about those kinds of things?
R:Well to me with my religion it’s kind of all right in the Bible. It says you should do this, you shouldn’t do this, you should do this, you shouldn’t do this, and that’s the way I look at things. And it’s not to benefit me. I do it because God said so.
I:Is there a difference between what your friends say is right and what society says is right versus what the Bible says is right?
R:Not really, because  kinda believe in the same things.
I:I mean your friends and you.
R:Yep.
I:In terms of societal things, like I mean, something like, I don’t know, living with your partner before getting married; I mean, a lot of people say that’s the right to do, but you wouldn’t agree, right?
R:Right.
I:So why? Like, what is it about, what makes that right what makes it wrong?
R:Well, you know, I also believe that I shouldn’t be sleeping with my partner until I get married. And I think if we were under the same roof it would be a little harder to not do that. And it’s just, we’re supposed to wait to live together before we get married. I know a lot of people do it, and I don’t believe, they probably don’t have the same religion as me.
I:Would you think it’s wrong for somebody to do that, or is it right for somebody to do that?
R:If they’re living together and they’re not sleeping together, then it would be fine, according to me.
I:What if they are sleeping together?
R:Then, according to my religion, it would be wrong.
I:So even if society says it’s right, you’d say your religion has to be the main determining…
R:In my life, yeah.
I:But  you would apply that to other people? Would you say other people shouldn’t be doing it?
R:I wouldn’t go up to them and say so. But the way I look at it, yeah.
I:And where do you think you’ve acquired these moral views from?
R:Well, my parents started it and I kinda just followed with it once I grew up.
I:Was that ever a struggle? Did you have to, did you ever disagree with them about these things? Did you always agree what they were
R:Yeah, for the most part. That’s the way I was brought up. I’ve always gone to a private school, and I’ve always taken religion classes in high school, and go to church, it’s, I’ve always agreed with it. It always makes sense.

R:How do I know?  I mean it’s really half is my religious background and the other half is more common sense… I know, I think about negative consequences before I do things.
I:That’s the common sense part?
R:Yeah.
I:And then what’s the religious background part?  What do you mean by that?
R:like, like relationship-wise, like I wouldn’t… religion would come into play with, you know, I would need a certain amount of time before I become intimate with anyone, that’s my religion.  Common sense reminds me that drinking and driving is… the fact that I have a lot of friends with DUIs and I can’t afford for my insurance to go up, so that’s my common sense.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide or know what’s right and wrong?
R:It’s easy.
I:Ok.  Has it gotten easier or harder in the last three years?
R:Easier.
I:Why do you think so?
R:because before I was more willing to do, you know, schemeful or do things that other people were doing, and now, it’s just focused on me and what I wanna do.
I:Mmhmm.  Ok.  Have any of your moral views or ethical views changed actually in the last two or three years?  Like you used to think something was right or wrong and now you don’t or…?
R:Yeah.
I:What?
R:sometimes when I was younger I would  and eventually I’d like to marry and that kind of stuff doesn’t really fly when you get older.
I:Mmhmm.  So how would you describe the moral change in that?  Looking back you realize now that it’s wrong to use alcohol, how would you describe that?
R:I would just say that I have… before all I thought about was the present and what would happen to me right then and how I felt right then, and now I think about how it’s gonna affect me in a year or two or who I might meet because of what I’m doing.
I:So is the change because you’re just at a different place and you realize things differently or were there actually sort of like hard knocks that woke you up to, oh my gosh, I can’t do that.
R:No, no hard knocks or whatever.
I:Ok.  What do you think it is, is it that makes something right or wrong?  I mean we’re talking about morality, good, bad, right or wrong.  What is it that makes anything right or wrong in the first place?
R:The consequences that come after it is completely what controls why I do the things I do.
I:What about the consequences?
R:if it’s gonna negatively effect my future, then I don’t, I consider that a negative consequence and I’ll  the frequency of doing anything that will negatively affect me.
I:Ok.  How does that… so that seems to fit with the common sense half that you talked about?  How about the consequence on how it will affect your future?  How does that fit in or not with the sort of the religious upbringing half?
R:I’m working on it.  As long as it’s not, you know, unfortunately it’s not one of my top priorities.
I:I’m not saying you should or anything, I’m just interested in sort of how you think about these things.
R:Oh I know.  you know to be completely honest, I always figure that one day, like, when I get married and I have kids and I’m going to decide to go back and…
I:To church or faith or something like that?
R:Church and faith on a regular basis.  which, it’ll be easier because I’ll have the motivation.
I:What would be the motivation then that you don’t have now?
R:because I want to raise my kids in a church, and they have those good morals that I had that you can’t, you know if your parents are teaching you, you know, some people do the exact opposite of what their parents say, so I’d rather get the whole, I say it, they say it, we say it, sort of thing and then just rely on them going with what I say.
I:so the getting married and having kids part would sort of kick that into gear?
R:Yeah.
I:And then do you think that it would be good for you?  I mean I hear what you’re saying about you’re not a morning person, your lifestyle, whatever.  Do you think at your age religion would be even relevant or has anyone to teach you?  I mean part of what I hear you saying is, you know, sorta like you need the Sunday school training and you need the basic morals laid down.  What about for someone who’s twenty or twenty-five?  Does religion have anything that’s worthwhile or is it just like, that’s not relevant?
R:It should, I mean if you’re having problems yourself with making the right decisions, I think that you need, which a lot of people do, you need that moral support or you know, you need to keep doing what’s right and wrong to go with God and then do what’s right, and then I say 100% you should go every Sunday, you should go every day if that’s what you need to do.  But if I have it gutted in me, and I feel like I make pretty good decisions without going every Sunday, then you know, it just doesn’t seem like a priority to me to go every Sunday.
I:Ok.  so back to the what makes something right or wrong?  So it’s mostly the consequences it will have for your future?
R:Yeah.
I:So might there be things that are right to do morally that don’t help your future or that hurt your future?  Or might there be things that are wrong to do that would help your future?
R:well I hope that I have a big conscience.  I can’t, I can’t, I feel like even if it’s not just directly about me, I feel like I care a lot about others and if it’s gonna hurt someone else in some other way, I don’t want any part of it.  I don’t want to be held responsible for anything that would happen to anybody else.  I feel like everyone has enough to themselves, they do not need someone else to bring them around.
I:So the consequences are for you and for everyone who you might influence?
R:Mmhmm.
I:Ok.  Are there any things that are just pure right or wrong, regardless of what their consequences are, it doesn’t matter, it’s just the act, you just do it or you don’t do it?  It has nothing to do with consequences.
R:No.  I don’t think that applies .","How do I know?

Oh I know.  you know to be completely honest, I always figure that one day, like, when I get married and I have kids and I’m going to decide to go back and… Church and faith on a regular basis.  which, it’ll be easier because I’ll have the motivation. because I want to raise my kids in a church, and they have those good morals that I had that you can’t, you know if your parents are teaching you, you know, some people do the exact opposite of what their parents say, so I’d rather get the whole, I say it, they say it, we say it, sort of thing and then just rely on them going with what I say. Yeah. It should, I mean if you’re having problems yourself with making the right decisions, I think that you need, which a lot of people do, you need that moral support or you know, you need to keep doing what’s right and wrong to go with God and then do what’s right, and then I say 100% you should go every Sunday, you should go every day if that’s what you need to do.  But if I have it gutted in me, and I feel like I make pretty good decisions without going every Sunday, then you know, it just doesn’t seem like a priority to me to go every Sunday. Yeah. well I hope that I have a big conscience.  I can’t, I can’t, I feel like even if it’s not just directly about me, I feel like I care a lot about others and if it’s gonna hurt someone else in some other way, I don’t want any part of it.  I don’t want to be held responsible for anything that would happen to anybody else.  I feel like everyone has enough to themselves, they do not need someone else to bring them around. Mmhmm.

R:Mainly my gut instinct, I guess like if I feel like it’s wrong—
I:In your gut?
R:Yeah, I don’t, if you could convince me, by book knowledge or statistics in real life, I believe it, otherwise I'm not going to believe it if my gut instinct tells me it’s something bad.

R:Pretty easy.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last 3 years?
R:Easier.
I:Do you have any reason why?
R:I think it’s because the older you get, the more knowledge you get and I don’t know, it’s just, been through a lot, learned a lot of life lessons, so.
I:Okay.  So have your views, your moral views changed much in the last 2-3 years?
R:Not really I don’t think, that I can think of right now.
I:What is it your think makes things right or wrong?  Where does right or wrong come from anyway?
R:I don’t know.  I guess it’s kind of a mixture between religion and society.
I:Tell me a little more about that.
R:Well society has their own views of what’s right or wrong as far as their morals, what most people believe in and religion is the same way.  They, you know, you go by the Bible and what’s in the Bible as far as what all is in the Bible—
I:So do those things actually make things really right or wrong or are those just sort of what people think is right or wrong.  Like if the majority of people decided some thing is wrong, it leads to nothing, can that truly be wrong or would that just be—?
R:It’s an opinion, opinion.
I:So what is it makes things like really right or wrong no matter what people think about it. Like people could be wrong that it is was right or wrong.
R:I don’t know, I mean the only way I know is if you do it and you find out that it’s wrong, if you see someone else doing it, I don’t know.
I:How would you find out it’s wrong, you mean if it has consequences?
R:Yeah.
I:Like some people would say rules or  or consequences or how it feels, God’s will, or these, are any of those how you think about why things are right and wrong?
R:I don’t know.  I don’t know.
I:Where, what makes it wrong, where does that come from?
R:Just um, if you hurt somebody, you would hurt somebody either by their feelings or physically.
I:Where do you think you have gotten your views about what are right or wrong things?  I mean you said in general, society and the Bible, is that what you mean for you yourself or your family, or?
R:Well I’ve kind of learned from past events which were I learned a lot of people that I don’t want to be like from my ex and his family, I learned who I do want to be like from my foster mom.

R:Um…I think my parents view are more right than my friends sometimes just because they’ll say something and to me it feels wrong but to them it can feel totally right.  It’s sort of like maybe like hanging out with friends or going out and partying all the time.  I know my parent’s views on that are right and I disagree with that completely, I don’t think you should just go have fun and waste your life but some of my friends disagree with that, I you know, I try to be an example to them but it’s hard.","Um…probably my parents and friends.  Just…I don’t know, growing up as a Christian I think it’s different. Not different, I think you deal with the same kind of stuff but…you’re pretty, I don’t know, you know the bible really well you would want to try to do what is right I guess. Yes. Um…I think my parents view are more right than my friends sometimes just because they’ll say something and to me it feels wrong but to them it can feel totally right.  It’s sort of like maybe like hanging out with friends or going out and partying all the time.  I know my parent’s views on that are right and I disagree with that completely, I don’t think you should just go have fun and waste your life but some of my friends disagree with that, I you know, I try to be an example to them but it’s hard.","The respondent believes that moral standards are influenced by their Christian upbringing and parents, feels that many teenagers have lost a sense of right and wrong due to societal pressures, and generally tries to uphold their values despite peer pressure, particularly regarding activities like partying and substance use.","I:how do you decide or know what’s good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:growing up I think my parents gave me morals and like I live by certain morals and really it’s like, my Christian walk and I know what’s right and wrong and I know what I’m gonna do and what I’m not gonna do. So it’s kinda like, not my parents like enforced anything on me but as I got older and now I sort of enforce certain things on me and lines that I can’t cross.
I:and you said those are based on the morals that your parents taught you?
R:yeah.
I:in general is it easy or hard for you to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:it’s really easy.
I:has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:it depends on the situation. I think it’ll always be a challenge, but just from like pressure around my friends and stuff, but…
I:um, so a minute ago when I asked if it’s gotten easier or harder for you to decide between right and wrong, whether it is you said that it’s easy and just now you said that in some situations it’s gotten harder. I’m curious, could you elaborate on that a little bit?
R:well I know what’s right and wrong so it’s easy for me to decide what I want to do but when I’m in a group of friends and they’re really pressuring me to do something, it can be a challenge at times. So it’s easy for me to know what’s right and wrong but at times it’s a challenge to make myself do what I know is right.
I:what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:um, I don’t know how to answer that …um, I don’t know, I think for me it’s like what I believe and…I really don’t know how to answer that question!
I:well how do you know that what you believe is right? Why is what you believe right?
R:because like…I’m sorry.
I:it’s fine, I can…if you’re having a hard time I can sort of, we can move on a little bit, it might help you.
R:okay, what…I’m a Christian and I believe that that’s right and that there is a god because I truly believe that…like I’ve felt his presence and I know that he’s guiding me in every way. I’ll pray about something and just like have my prayer request written out and if I look back like months later I’m like wow, that’s amazing, god really answered those prayers, maybe not the way that I thought so but he answered them still and I’m not even worried about that situation anymore. And I know it’s right because I see god moving in my life and my family and my friends.
I:okay, so in a sense what you think makes something right or wrong is…god?
R:yeah.
I:are there any actions that are always wrong in and of themselves?
R:I’m not sure I understand what you mean by that?
I:are there any things that are just wrong no matter what, no matter of circumstances, regardless of anything, they’re just wrong?
R:yeah, I think so!
I:can you give me some examples?
R:um, I think like sex outside of marriage is really wrong. I have a really hard time when people like do drugs around me or smoke, I don’t think drinking is necessarily wrong but it gets to a point where it is wrong. Just like things you can do to hurt people, intentionally.
I:so intentionally hurting people is wrong?
R:yes.
I:so what makes these things wrong?
R:um, the consequences that you reap from them, I mean, like sex outside of marriage, you can get pregnant and you can have a kid and that might not be what you wanted. And if that happened to one of my friends I’d be like, well you were really wrong in that situation but I’ll still be there for you.
I:that’s fine. From where have you acquired your moral views, where have they come from?
R:my family and my faith.","growing up I think my parents gave me morals and like I live by certain morals and really it’s like, my Christian walk and I know what’s right and wrong and I know what I’m gonna do and what I’m not gonna do.

R:Just like growing up as a kid, everyone has their own morals.  And I am a Christian, so just reading a Bible, I know what’s right and wrong.  Everybody does.
I:Ok.  In general, do you think it’s easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I don’t think it’s hard.  I think it’s pretty easy for me.
I:And do you think it’s gotten easier or harder over the last few years?
R:Easier.
I:Why?
R:I feel like in the last couple of years, I’ve really started to know who I really am and my faith has gotten a lot stronger.
I:Ok, that’s ok. We’ll just keep going.  So how about this, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Like you said you just know, but what is it that you know?  What’s the difference?
R:Like do you want an example?
I:No, not necessarily, I mean if it, if it’s an example, that’s fine, but more so how, what is it that makes something the right decision .  Is it a feeling, is it a consequence?
R:I think it can be both, like for me, it’s just my beliefs and what I’ve thought up in my head is right and wrong, and I’m not going to go out and sleep with somebody before I get married, I’m going to save myself until I get married.  And if I were to do that, that’s wrong.  I know it’s wrong because my head and heart say it’s wrong.  And that’s what I believe in and I’m not going to go do that, you know?
I:So when your head and your heart tell you it’s wrong is it because of how it would make you feel, or because of the outcome, or because of your beliefs?
R:Everything.  All of the above.
I:And you just are aware of all of that .
R:Yeah, it’s just like I know it’s wrong right from the beginning, and that might be a struggle for me, like I don’t want to do that.  And it’s just like going to church my whole life, and having my parents tell me what’s right and wrong and like growing up like “This is bad for you, don’t do this.”  And growing up, I feel like I can make my decisions, but I feel like since my parents and I believe from the same level, we have the same belief level.  Like they taught me what’s right.  They taught me what they believed, that’s now what I believe.  So what they see as right and what they see as wrong, almost everything lines up with each other.  And so like I’m a Christian, I’m going to try to follow God’s Word, not my parents’ word, but what the Bible says.  And I’m not a stupid person, and I know when I’m doing something wrong, and I know what I’m doing.  I don’t always think like “Oh, this is the right thing.”  You know?  I don’t consciously think it’s just like walking down the street and just the decisions I make daily.
I:So your beliefs disagree with your parents?
R:No.  No they don’t.  Just like my relationship with God isn’t going to be the same as both of theirs.  They might feel really strongly about something, but I might take that in a completely different way.  I know that we all believe the same thing in general, but like…
I:Some of those specific…
R:Yeah.
I:And so a lot of, so this kind of internal sense of this is right or wrong is because of the church teachings and what your parents have taught you?
R:Yeah.","Just like growing up as a kid, everyone has their own morals.  And I am a Christian, so just reading a Bible, I know what’s right and wrong.  Everybody does. I don’t think it’s hard.

R:Since I’m religious, a lot of it comes from the Bible and then if it’s not, then just think about what’s involved. Are you hurting other people? What are the consequences, you know?
I:Consequences for them and for you?
R:Yeah, the consequences of each action. If the consequence is someone’s feelings get hurt, the consequence is you hurt yourself but the plus side is it feels good or it makes me happy or whatever, then it’s probably bad.
I:Would you say that, in general, it’s easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy for me to decide. It’s hard for me to do.
I:So that was going to be one of the next questions was, when you know what’s right and wrong, how hard or easy is it for you to actually do the right thing?
R:It’s very hard.
I:Why do you think?
R:Because I mean, you get very good justifications, you know what you’re doing is bad, but in your mind, you can always make up some reasons, some excuse why it’s okay.
I:Would you say that deciding between right or wrong has gotten easier or harder in the last few years?
R:It’s been harder.
I:Harder, why?
R:I didn’t make any decisions. I never made any decisions before, you know.
I:So your dad was making them? Or…
R:Yeah, I didn’t really have any input on anything. So now it’s like I have a bunch of decisions to make, so many decisions to make. And when I make those decisions, I have to sit through them all. It’s a lot harder to sit through the decisions than to have one option presented.
I:Yeah, where there’s no choice at all, right?
R:Yeah.
I:What is it you think that actually makes something right or wrong? Was is it about your action or whatever that makes something right or makes something wrong?
R:Intention and consequences, I think.
I:Say more about intentions. What do you mean?
R:Well, I have an idea about perspectives and perception, which is you ask somebody, if it’s okay to steal and they say no. And you ask the person, well; what if your family hadn’t eaten in a week, your son was going to die? There was a loaf of bread there, it didn’t belong to you, would you take it? Yes. So, well, you just stole. So I think that even the most rigid, judgmental or morally pompous people, if under the right circumstances or the wrong circumstances, would do something that they’d regret, do something they wouldn’t normally do, or do something they’d speak out against. So intention and then the circumstance have a lot to do, I think, with what’s right and what’s wrong.
I:You mentioned earlier consequences. You mentioned earlier this religious Bible. How do those things fit into knowing what makes something right and what makes something wrong?
R:A lot of people think that the Bible is like a very rigid kind of set of rules, and there are rules, but there’s also a lot of principles in it where if you look at it and say, okay, what’s the purpose behind it? Take for example, the most  example of the Sabbath. If you look at what the purpose of it was, okay, so it’s doing work on the Sabbath, it was for rest. It was for people to have a day of rest. But if you take it to the point where you’re not allowed to cook dinner because that’s work on the Sabbath, then you have to think about the principle behind it is.
I:The point as opposed to little tiny picky rules.
R:The point of it is you have a day of rest, not a day of starvation, day of rest. If you’re hungry, well, eat something because you’re not resting, if you’re actually starving all day.
I:And consequences, do you mean yourself? Or did you say that? I forgot exactly what you said.
R:Consequence is basically what’s going to be the reaction to your actions for anything that you do. Speeding, what’s the consequence? Okay, you can get a ticket. Okay, yeah, so that means you got to pay money but you could hit somebody, worst consequence. You could say, well, speeding doesn’t really hurt anybody so it’s not really wrong, but it potentially can and the potential con of speeding is a lot greater than the pay off of I get there three minutes faster. So you just have to weigh your decision carefully.
I:Where would you say that you’ve gotten your moral views from?
R:Bible probably, family.","Since I’m religious, a lot of it comes from the Bible and then if it’s not, then just think about what’s involved. Are you hurting other people? What are the consequences, you know? Yeah, the consequences of each action. If the consequence is someone’s feelings get hurt, the consequence is you hurt yourself but the plus side is it feels good or it makes me happy or whatever, then it’s probably bad. It’s easy for me to decide. It’s hard for me to do. It’s very hard. Because I mean, you get very good justifications, you know what you’re doing is bad, but in your mind, you can always make up some reasons, some excuse why it’s okay. It’s been harder. I didn’t make any decisions. I never made any decisions before, you know. Yeah, I didn’t really have any input on anything. So now it’s like I have a bunch of decisions to make, so many decisions to make. And when I make those decisions, I have to sit through them all. It’s a lot harder to sit through the decisions than to have one option presented. Yeah.  Intention and consequences, I think. Well, I have an idea about perspectives and perception, which is you ask somebody, if it’s okay to steal and they say no. And you ask the person, well; what if your family hadn’t eaten in a week, your son was going to die? There was a loaf of bread there, it didn’t belong to you, would you take it? Yes. So, well, you just stole. So I think that even the most rigid, judgmental or morally pompous people, if under the right circumstances or the wrong circumstances, would do something that they’d regret, do something they wouldn’t normally do, or do something they’d speak out against. So intention and then the circumstance have a lot to do, I think, with what’s right and what’s wrong. A lot of people think that the Bible is like a very rigid kind of set of rules, and there are rules, but there’s also a lot of principles in it where if you look at it and say, okay, what’s the purpose behind it? Take for example, the most  example of the Sabbath. If you look at what the purpose of it was, okay, so it’s doing work on the Sabbath, it was for rest. It was for people to have a day of rest. But if you take it to the point where you’re not allowed to cook dinner because that’s work on the Sabbath, then you have to think about the principle behind it is. The point of it is you have a day of rest, not a day of starvation, day of rest. If you’re hungry, well, eat something because you’re not resting, if you’re actually starving all day. Consequence is basically what’s going to be the reaction to your actions for anything that you do. Speeding, what’s the consequence? Okay, you can get a ticket. Okay, yeah, so that means you got to pay money but you could hit somebody, worst consequence. You could say, well, speeding doesn’t really hurt anybody so it’s not really wrong, but it potentially can and the potential con of speeding is a lot greater than the pay off of I get there three minutes faster. So you just have to weigh your decision carefully.  Bible probably, family.","The respondent expresses a strong inclination to help others with money, influenced by their religious beliefs and the consequences of actions, while acknowledging the difficulty of making moral decisions and the impact of social influences, particularly from family and scripture."

R:I don't know.",Whatever I think is right and what’s wrong. I don't know. I don't know.,"The respondent expresses uncertainty about right and wrong, citing social influences from their family and teachers regarding cheating and lying, while also referencing religious beliefs that inform their views on morality, particularly the idea that God dictates what is right and wrong.",,,,"I:How do you normally decide what’s good or bad or right or wrong in life?
R:From my mother.  My mother was always open with me from a young age.  I knew a lot about the family, just about everything that was going on.  Nobody else knew, not even my older cousins.  So when I got around to talking to them about it, they’re like, “Wow.  You know a lot.  Wow.”  So I guess I’ve just been wise for a while, because of my mother.
I:In general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It depends on what the right and wrong is.  I’m not gonna lie, when it comes to smoking weed, it’s harder for me, because that’s what I like to do.  But now with my daughter, choosing between right and wrong, that’s simple.  I know what I have to do.  I know when I’m not being a good parent and when I am.
I:How do you know?
R:Say I’m out with my cousin and we’re on the corner, sitting at the park, smoking or something,  or I could be at my cousin’s house, rapping with them, and I ask my aunt, “Oh, can you watch Kamalia* while I run to the store real quick?”  I went to the store; I went to the store.  But now I’m sitting with my cousins and we’re smoking.  And she calls me, “Okay, Maya*, you got to come get her, because I’m going somewhere today.  I got to get ready.”  Okay, I’m on my way.  And I’m not on my way.  I’m not leaving for about another 15 minutes.  That’s when I know I’m being a bad parent.  I’m putting things before her.  I start feeling guilty and I got to go.  I just tell them I got to go, I can’t do this.  Got to go get my baby, and I zoom home.  It’s hard.  I think I’m doing a good job.
I:Do you think deciding between right and wrong’s gotten easier or harder in the last couple years, or has it stayed the same?
R:It’s been easier, because before, I didn’t care.  My mother told me I was going to be like that because whenever she used to tell me about myself, I would say, “I don’t care.  Okay, ma, I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care.”  As I got older, I started saying, “I don’t give a blah.”  That’s what I would do.  I actually was showing I didn’t care, really, and that’s how it was.  I was doing whatever I wanted to do.  I want to stay out at a friend’s house for a week, and that’s fine with their parents, then that’s what I was going to do.  It didn’t matter if my mother said yes or no.  That’s what I’m doing.  Doesn’t matter if she has something planned.  I’ve gotten a lot better.  I know how to put my priorities first.
I:What changed?
R:Just the whole being in the system.  That hurts, being in the system.  You don’t have control over your life, you feel like somebody’s controlling your life.  It was like, I don’t know what my next move is.  It’s whatever the judge decides is my next move.  All I knew is I’m having a baby, I got to get it together, because somebody’s watching me now.  I got to look after her.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  What is it about things that are right that make them right?  What is it about things that are wrong that make them wrong?
R:Maybe in some cases the people you’re hurting.  If you’re hurting people, if it’s right or wrong.  That’s a lot of thing with me and Cory*.  Right from wrong, that’s how I can look at it with his situation.  The wrong thing hurt me.  If he did the right thing, I wouldn’t have been hurt.
I:Do you think people can do something that is right that also hurts somebody?
R:Yeah.
I:How so?
R:Telling the truth.  That’s right, but the truth does hurt sometimes.
I:What about the other way around?  Do you think somebody can do something wrong that helps somebody?
R:Yeah.  That’s how it was a lot.  That’s what the robberies was about, with me and my cousin.  It was something wrong, but it was to help out at home.  We didn’t have any money.  My mother wanted rent money from everybody.  Nobody had a job.  He’s 28, no job.  I’m 17.  I’m trying to help out some type of way.  How can we get some money quick?  We were thinking about robbing somebody.  Just a lot of different things.  The wrong thing, but we’re trying to do the right thing.
I:Where would you say your moral views have come from?

How do you decide what’s good or bad, but it sounds like you’ve addressed those by talking about your parents and your church, um, can you give me a specific example of something that would be seen as clearly right or clearly wrong, maybe in your parents’ eyes or in the eyes of people in your church?

I:Yeah, an example of like a situation that would be just clearly you know, something that would be clearly wrong to do, for example?
R:Okay something that would be clearly wrong.
I:Not saying that you would do it, but just kind of curious of an example of something that would be wrong, morally, or, or—
R:Like something that would be wrong is like going out drinking and getting drunk and knowing that that’s not the right thing to do.

R:Yeah.
I:And where, what do they kind of base their morals on?  Like whatever it is they teach you, are they teaching you stuff from their religion or are they teaching things are wrong because of the consequences?
R:They do a lot of both honestly.  They teach me from their religion and they also teach me because sometimes it’s really not the right thing to do, sometimes it is.
I:Do you feel like feelings play any kind of part in morality?
R:Yeah, I mean I kind of agree, but I mean sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing.  I admit that.  I know that’s a fact ‘cuz that was a hard lesson learned to me.

Right!

That’s, that’s really ah,  um, ah, I would have to say that I mean it’s still wrong, but in that time frame and people are just, it’s almost to a point of that where like the way someone is brought up is if you’re so blind that you believe it’s right it’s almost like you’re brainwashed and you really can’t decide that it’s wrong and that’s the way a lot of the South was just, yeah.

R:Um, if, if someone is gonna get hurt as a result of it, then it’s wrong and other than that it’s, I don’t know, that’s pretty much, you know, like I always, if I’m thinking of right and wrong, it’s usually, you know, is this, is this gonna hurt someone, you know like even, you know, like hurt their feelings, hurt their, like hurt them physically, you know, that would be terrible, but that, that’s pretty much, and then like just like morals, you know, like something you don’t want to do just because you believe, you know, you shouldn’t be doing it.
I:Like what kinds of things?
R:Um, you know, like I’d never go out and like uh, commit vandalism or something because like any time I see that I’m, that’s like, I couldn’t ever, you know like even just spray paint on something because it doesn’t belong to me.
I:Okay um, what kinds of, I mean, you said would hurt other people, like what kinds of, well that’s hmm, what kinds of consequences, what kinds of harm do you think are the kinds of harm that, you mentioned feelings, hurting somebody’s feelings, you mentioned, now what if doing something that you felt was right would hurt someone’s feelings, I mean, how would you, I guess, adjudicate between?

Um, if, if someone is gonna get hurt as a result of it, then it’s wrong and other than that it’s, I don’t know, that’s pretty much, you know, like I always, if I’m thinking of right and wrong, it’s usually, you know, is this, is this gonna hurt someone, you know like even, you know, like hurt their feelings, hurt their, like hurt them physically, you know, that would be terrible, but that, that’s pretty much, and then like just like morals, you know, like something you don’t want to do just because you believe, you know, you shouldn’t be doing it. Um, you know, like I’d never go out and like uh, commit vandalism or something because like any time I see that I’m, that’s like, I couldn’t ever, you know like even just spray paint on something because it doesn’t belong to me. Um, Yeah, it’s tough. I really don’t care. My friends, they can, you know, I don’t, it’s not that important to me to like impress somebody to, you know, like if it’s, especially if it’s gonna hurt somebody else, you know. Um, well, sure there are. Like violence um, any kind of like um, just you know, like being mean to someone, you know, like putting somebody down and stuff, that’s, it can’t be good in any way, you know.  I think it’s just from everybody around you.  You soak in something from everyone and it just helps shape who you are. Definitely my whole family and all my friends without a question, they just, you learn a lot from your fiends.","The respondent would use an inheritance to support their family and buy a car, makes decisions about right and wrong based on religion and ethics, believes that actions are wrong if they hurt others, feels influenced by family and friends in shaping their moral views, and emphasizes the importance of community and helping others while expressing a desire to teach and foster understanding in society.","I:How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I just, a lot of times it’s just I have a gut decision.  Not a gut decision, but a gut feeling but that’s based on how I was raised and you just know what’s right.  You don’t, you treat people fairly and you do, yeah, you treat people how you’d like to feel or how you’d like to be treated and you try to leave the world better than you found it.  That’s, really if you have those two rules, the golden rule and that one, my Dad’s always said, you try and leave the world better than you found it.  So as long as you have that, you can pretty much make any decision.  Is this gonna leave things worse or is it gonna make things better.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I’d say it’s pretty easy.  There’s always like people that can concoct like a situation that they’re like you know, what would you do here, and I think you have to sit there forever but, for the most part, like the decision is pretty easy.  Like as soon as we heard that somebody got shot in the street over, I’m like, well, I’m gonna get you out of there.  It’s my girlfriend.  And ah, that’s just the obvious decision.  That’s not like a right or wrong decision, it’s just like, well it’s not safe, you know?  So that comes first.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past few years?
R:Harder, because the decisions are more serious.  Like I have to not fight my girlfriend’s Dad about how he’s, I mean, this is just between us but he calls her a quitter for not doing pharmacy school anymore.  She can’t take it, she can’t stand it, it’s like just too stressful.  She says no one should go through that much stress to get C’s or B’s and then like she’s got to apply to schools, like an actual pharmacy school and she applied this year, which is a year early, but then she went to talk to somebody and they said that you probably won’t get in next year because it’s just so competitive so she wants to go into something that’s less competitive, still almost as lucrative and I don’t really care about money, but she kinda does, her family does definitely and so her Dad calls her a quitter.  Like I would never, like that’s immature and an awful thing but it’s my decision that I should stay out of it.  I talk to her about it, but I would never say something to him unless it became like, I mean, if she came to me crying, like it just bothers her.  If it was really killing her, then I would do something.
I:So how did you decide to sort of stay out of it, what was that decision process like?
R:That was, I actually talked it over with my parents.  And then to be honest, I was going to do something.  And I talked to them and they’re like you know what?  You can’t.  And I never even thought about that I, that it was not my place.  It was just like if she feels terrible I have to change it, you know?  And that’s what my job is.  To make her feel good, so I wanted to change it and I talked to them and they’re like, no, that’s not your place.
I:What is it do you think that makes something right or wrong?
R:It always depends on the situation but I mean, if it’s going to harm someone, cause problems for people, if it’s selfish, if it’s, I mean obviously in terms of like the environment, if you’re, like I always just say, if you’re leaving the world better than you found it then it’s a good thing.  If you’re making things worse, then it’s a bad things.
I:Well where do you think, we talked about this, but where do you think your moral views come from?
R:Mainly my parents, my family.  But not just my parents, my whole extended family because things always come up and if you have a good family that you really care about and respect, not only are you like, when an issue comes up, like I have some family members that love to talk about like all the political stuff and when things come up, you really do learn from them just by talking about it.  And other than that, like it’s, you think about this whole family that you have, every time a decision like that comes up, even if you don’t think about it, it’s in the back of your head that like, this is a world that not just I live in, that my little sister lives in and my cousin Brendan and I don’t want them to grow up with this going on, so that a lot of times helps me make a decision.","I just, a lot of times it’s just I have a gut decision.

R:It’s kind of scary sometimes because I don’t know.  I just try to look at what I’ve learned and the experiences I’ve been through to decide, but I still do learn things every day and encounter different things every day that I guess sometimes you didn’t know.  But I guess if I’m unsure, I might talk to someone close about it, maybe a friend that’s a little bit older than me and might know.
I:So in general, would you say it’s pretty easy or pretty hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:In general, I think it’s pretty easy.
I:And do you think it’s gotten easier or harder in the past couple years?
R:I think it’s gotten easier.  I think I’ve learned a lot more.
I:So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong, like what’s the reason it’s right or wrong?
R:I think that has a lot to do with there are obvious things that are right and wrong and it’s just kind of something that everyone knows.  And there are some things where you have to just go with your instincts, I guess.  I don’t know what the reasoning is.  I never really thought about it.
I:Well, like in the situation with the woman who ordered the drink while she was pregnant, what was, would you think – I mean it just sounds like you were weighing a lot of different – you know your manager was saying one thing, your instinct was telling you a different thing, and the law was saying one thing.  So what do you think, in all those things, was right?  I mean there was also what she was doing, too, so there’s sort of four different things to decide on.
R:It was right for her, a good decision that if she was going to drink with her friends, a good idea that she only had one, even though I don’t agree with having anything.  The law isn’t always fair or right, but you do have to abide by it.  So I guess that’s why I was asking if it was illegal or not.  The reasoning for me to serve it to her is because I kind of had to, even though I didn’t agree with it.  I don’t know.
I:So some people talk about kind of consequences to other people, like if it hurts someone, or they talk about the law or kind of just what someone else, someone they trust, tells them or things like that.  So what do you think?  If you had to pick sort of among those things, what are the ways that you typically decide what’s right or wrong?  Is it based on any one of those?
R:I guess I would want to go to someone to see what they think about it, but from there, I still have to make my decision.  I’m not just going to say, oh, well, this person said this, so that’s how I’m going to think.  I think that it is a good idea to talk to someone about it and see how they feel and maybe they can bring out some positive or negative things about it that you think, and then I just feel I can get a little bit more out of it and make my decision.
I:And so do you make the decision on how it would affect you, how it would affect others?  What’s the –
R:Well, in that situation, I was basing my decision on not me at all, but her baby because we do see way too many things go wrong with children when they’re born because of what their parents do.  That’s who I was the most concerned about.","It’s kind of scary sometimes because I don’t know.

R:Well, shooting someone with a gun could kill them but a shot doesn’t.
I:Okay, what if the shot actually does kill the person just because it’s an over injection or something like that?
R:Oh, well then you’d have to look more off the situation, what was in the shot that caused the person to die, was it an accident or was it intentional, stuff like that.
I:If it was intentional what would make it wrong?
R:Because the person died.
I:Because the person died.

R:Rape, oh yeah, yeah that would be one that is always wrong.  I didn’t think of it.
I:Alright so why is that wrong?
R:Because that person doesn’t want it, they don’t want to have sex with the person and that’s just fine.

Yeah.","The respondent plans to bank the inheritance and use part of it for a car and insurance, believes that actions are right or wrong based on whether they cause harm to oneself or others, and holds firm moral views that are self-derived, asserting that societal acceptance does not dictate morality, while also expressing concerns about the influence of religion on government decisions.","I:Ok.  How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad and right and wrong in life?
R:I guess instinct, what I feel about it.
I:What you feel about it, ok.  Like is it easy or hard in general for you to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:Fairly easy.
I:Ok, and has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder for you over the last couple years?
R:I think no difference.
I:Ok, pretty much the same?
R:Yeah.
I:and have your views changed in the last couple years at all in any way about what’s right and wrong?
R:No.
I:Ok.  what is it that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um,
I:Like some people say it’s just feelings, like it feels right and then it’s right, other people say it’s consequences, what’s got bad results then it’s probably wrong.
R:Yeah, I would think the consequences of it.
I:Consequences are more important?  Like what about rules?  Like some people say that there’re just some things that are wrong, you should never steal, you should never cheat somebody…  Are there things that are absolutely wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Could you give me examples of what you think those might be?
R:Murder, probably.
I:Right.  So even if it has good consequences you would say it’s…?
R:See, I’m not a bad person.","I guess instinct, what I feel about it. Fairly easy. I think no difference. Yeah. No.  Um, Yeah, I would think the consequences of it. Yeah. Murder, probably.

R:Mm hmm.
I:Now why is that?  It’s gotta be more than just how they were raised.
R:Yeah it’s because it’s somebody else’s stuff and-
I:Like the stealing.  Any what if somebody said “I don’t care I want to make it my stuff.”
R:It’s still theirs though (laughs).

R:Yeah.
I:Is it- something other than- what if the government changed the law and said “If you’re powerful you can steal.”
R:But still by the Bible we’re not supposed to steal, so.
I:So that’s something new, the Bible teaches?  Do you what the government puts into law reflects?
R:Sometimes.
I:So ultimately, what’s right or wrong, does it come from just whatever you believe?  Whatever society says?  What the Bible teaches?  What God says?  What the consequences are?  What, what makes something right or wrong?
R:The Bible, what God says.
I:And that’s the most basic.
R:Mm hmm.

R:My mom influenced me.
I:Your mom... Uh-huh... What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:What?
I:What do you think makes something right of wrong?  Why is something good and something bad?
R:Well, I think one should take it, I don't know... like it best suits him, I don't know... As it is more convenient to him, you know.  This is good for me, it's a good thing.  This is not too convenient, it's something bad.
I:Well, I can say... if I have a son, I can say, ""going out with my boyfriend is good for me"", but... then is that good, to leave my children like that?
R:No, because there I think you should talk in the relationship, talk with your children and ask them if they approve it, and if not it all depends as well.
I:So, in general, what makes something good or bad, in general?  You said, you have to approve of it, but other people have to approve of it too, or what?
R:Well, I think it's how each one feels about it.
I:Uh-huh.
R:If you feel good, you know, the rest doesn't matter.  If you feel bad then you have to consider other aspects of, you know, life and all that.
I:Uh-huh... How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Well, for example, you can see in other people.  Consequences that you see in other people too.
I:Consequences... Uh-huh... Can you give me an example?
R:Well, there are people at school that skip classes, they don't go to class.  So they think oh well, I'm with my friends, or nothing is going to happen.  But they start to figure out, as time goes by... and when they get to... I've known people that get to the last grade, senior year and then they realize that what they've been doing is bad and sometimes they aren't able to graduate, or something like that.","My mom influenced me.

R:I don’t know.  To be honest, because all of this stuff has been going on in the world, I’ve been getting kind of scared.
I:Of what?
R:I don’t know.  Because like I hear people talk and – about the world coming to an end and that scares me.
I:So it scares you.  What does that have to do with the way you think about right and wrong or good and bad?
R:Because I’m – I want to do better, you know.  I don’t want to be in hell burning up.  I don’t want to be.  I know I probably sound crazy, but I don’t want to be there.  I want to be, you know, as they like to call it, “paradise,” you know.  So if it’s – if I don’t think that it’s something that God would want, I try not to do it.
I:OK.  So in general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide what’s right and wrong in life?
R:It’s not hard at all.  It’s not hard, I just think about it.  Or if I’m having trouble I’ll call my mom and ask her to help me out with it, like what does she think.  And if I can’t decide and she has an idea I’ll go with what she says.
I:So do you feel like deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder in the last few years or has it stayed the same?
R:Got easier, you know, I grew up.
I:It’s gotten easier in what way?
R:Before like I wouldn’t know what’s right or what’s wrong, too tough, or even if I did, you know, I didn’t care.  But, you know, now that I’m growing up, I guess I’m maturing more, and it’s easier, it’s like common sense, don’t do this, don’t do that.
I:OK.  So would you say your views about right and wrong has changed over the last few years or no?
R:Yeah.
I:In what ways?
R:For example, like – I’m trying to think of an example.  Like people that can say, “keeping it real.”  Keeping it real could hurt peoples feelings.  And before I didn’t care, I just would say it.  Well, now I’m more cautious, you know.
I:Is there any particular reason why you’re more cautious?
R:No, I don’t know.  I just changed.  I don’t know.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know.
I:What about like rules or laws or consequences or how it feels or God or something else, like any of those things are what makes something right or wrong?
R:Yeah, no, you’re right.
I:No.  I mean which ones of those things do you think about, any of those things?
R:Well, God, you know, the law.  I don’t want to be sitting in jail, that has a lot to do with it.  Those two things.  Just those two things.
I:Why those things in particular?
R:Because I don’t want to do any wrong – anything wrong, you know, that I have to worry about not getting caught.  And if I do get caught, I don’t want to be sitting in jail for doing something stupid that I could have avoided.  Like even if I didn’t get caught, I still have to live with that.  And God watches everything that we do, you know.
I:What do you think would happen, like what kinds of things happen if you do wrong things?
R:What do you mean?
I:Like you were saying that you don’t want to worry about going to jail and stuff, and then like you know, so you don’t want to worry about other things happening when you do wrong things, what kinds of things happen, maybe wrong things?
R:I know a lot of people with guns, and stuff like that, and they just don’t care.  Everybody I know, not everybody, but just about everybody I know they’ve been in jail at least once or twice.  And I don’t want a life like that.  And even I don’t want my daughter growing up like that.  I don’t want her looking and, you know, thinking that’s OK.  Because it’s not OK.  So I have her to think about.  It’s not just me anymore.
I:What about your own ideas about right and wrong, where do you think they come from?
R:Some of it comes – some of them, like me and mom will talked about that and ask where it comes from.  Like I just listen to my mom say stuff, now that I think about it, I’m like oh, she’s actually right.  But some of it, you know, it’s just common sense.  A 12-year-old shouldn’t be holding a gun, or you shouldn’t be doing drugs, it shouldn’t be okay – like I was reading the newspaper a couple of weeks ago, I don’t know if you read it about the Latin king and gangs, bringing little kids into it.  They’re born in – because their parents are, you know, in the gang Latin King order, and they’re automatically born into it.  So they don’t have to fight over anything to get into it, but now they’re in the gang and they’re stuck, you know.  That’s wrong.  It shouldn’t be like that.
I:Why do you think it shouldn’t be like that?
R:Because they didn’t have a choice.  And even if they did, they’re just kids.","I don’t know.

I have some questions about morality.  Right, wrong, good bad, um, how, um, how do you go about deciding moral issues for yourself?

R:Uh, probably just my parents influence.  I guess.
I:Do you think you reflect pretty much what they believe or have taught you?
R:Yeah.
I:Uh-huh.  Okay.  In general is it hard for you to know in different situations what is right and wrong to do and to be and think or do you pretty much know right and wrong?

R:Uh, it probably depends on the situation I guess.  The consequences.
I:Okay.  Um, so, um, this whole idea of right and wrong, certain things that are wrong, bad, evil, some things are good, right, true, just, worthy, whatever.  That’s pretty common.  I mean not everyone lives up to it, but do you, what do you, what is it that makes anything right or wrong?  Where does right or wrong even come from?

I:Okay what if people are raised really differently?  Do they each have a separate morality?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, so if somebody was in a really lousy, screwed up family, and their parents raised them, you need to cheat all you can, and steal whenever you have the chance without getting caught, and
R:Well if that was what I was told all the time growing up I would probably think that too.
I:Okay, but would you say that they’re wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:That those things are wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:That they’re misled?

I:Okay, so you have some standard that enables you to judge them as wrong, even though they think that way.
R:Yeah.
I:And where does that standard come from?  What makes them wrong even though they think that it isn’t?
R:Um, well because I think there’s some kind of overall moral standard and they’re not, which I would say that I live by more, more closely, and they’re kind of far away from that radar.
I:And is that overall moral standard, um, society’s invention?
R:Yeah.
I:Or is it just the way things are, does it come from God, where does it come from?

I:Is it possible that society on the earth could evolve so that murder is okay?  Stealing is okay?  And that would make it okay?
R:I mean not in my mind, it couldn’t, but, probably, I mean, 1000 years ago or whatever they probably didn’t think that having sex before marriage was okay and they probably didn’t think, well not the same as murder, but surely like, in their minds it was up there and people don’t give a second thought to it.","Uh, probably just my parents influence.

Cause then they look up to you more and they can trust you, unlike some kids like little kids they’ll treat you like a little kid, like you cannot be trusted and you have no responsibility. Like I believe that smoking is wrong, but some people do it anyways because they think that they need to do it.  And stuff, and like, and getting pregnant at a young age you know, they think they want to do it and stuff but really once they find out how hard it is to raise a child, they don’t want to do it anymore. I think it’s wrong because like just the tobacco company’s used to push a lot for like young kids to do it and the thing is that it’s so addicting that people die from it every day.  I don’t think that that’s right, and I think that it should be illegal, like, like pot and stuff and weed because if, I think it’s just as bad as that stuff.  It’s addicting and it can kill you.  What’s the point of having it? I don’t think that’s right, because if, like I said, weed is illegal, it’s a drug, so does that give, that doesn’t give anybody the right to smoke it but what if it wasn’t?

R:Um.  That’s kind of hard to, like I know like things that are illegal are probably usually always wrong, even though people do them anyways.  So.  Probably, but I can’t really think of anything.
I:Yeah.  So even if they decide for themselves they think it’s right, do you think you can still say it’s wrong?

R:You just know what’s good and what’s bad.
I:You just know?
R:I mean, some things I do that’s bad but I know they’re bad. I guess anything I know I’d do that society would label as bad, I think I’d know it’s bad, I just don’t care.

R:No.
I:In general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Not hard.
I:Not hard?
R:No.
I:So do you think deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years.
R:Easier, way easier.
I:How come?
R:Well, you don’t have to worry about what people would think. What you choose, if they were right or to become more aware, you know what I mean? Because a few years ago, I’d been at school so I mean if something’s wrong I care.  If it’s wrong then I care.
I:So let’s see, have your views on right and wrong changed at all in the last couple of years?
R:No, I don’t think so.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?

I:Let’s see, what do you think is it like, maybe rules or laws or consequences, how it feels, God’s will?
R:Yeah, consequences.
I:Consequences?
R:Consequences, yeah.
I:What kinds of consequences do you think makes something wrong?
R:Well, if you get in trouble for doing it, I guess it’s wrong. When I guess it’s wrong, society is going to view it as wrong.
I:Do you think there are things that are wrong that you wouldn’t necessarily have consequence for?
R:I’m trying to think of an example. But I’m going to say yes. But on one thing I’m going to say, probably yeah. I can’t tell you anything.
I:What about…like what if someone could do something wrong and not get caught? What do you think about that? Would that still be wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:How come?
R:Because it’s wrong. If it’s wrong, it’s wrong. Just because you don’t get caught doesn’t mean it is not wrong anymore.

R:Maybe it’s good.
I:Do you think that’d still be wrong?

R:How do I decide like what’s right and wrong?
I:Yeah.
R:Lot of it has to do with my parents and how I was raised and everything.  I was raised, you know, try to be good, try to stay out of trouble, though every now and then it sort of backfires on me, but not too often anymore.  But I think a lot of that had to do with the age I was and everything like that.  I’ve tried to get older and a little more mature.
I:How would you describe how you were raised?  When it comes to morality.
R:Yeah, just very different, rights and wrongs, not really too much gray area in between, “well it could be…” you know.  I really can’t think of a way to really define it, but…
I:So what are things that are definitely in your house right or wrong?
R:Right, I always, be polite, you know.  Do what you’re supposed do, do what you’re told, help somebody out if they need help or somethin’ like that.  Wrong’s just, you know don’t be out in drugs, drinkin’, smokin’, anything like that.
I:What’s wrong with those things?
R:They just never, my mom’s never liked smokin’ or nothin’ like that.  Like my mom’s whole side of the family does and she never really has liked that at all.

I can only think of twice when he’s had more than just one beer at the house, just kind of sittin’ around, and that’s it.
I:Let me just put it this way, let’s suppose you wanted to push your parents on this.  I agree with this but tell me why.  What would the answer be?
R:They’d probably say cause that’s how we was raised, that’s how we were taught, somethin’ like that probably—
I:--but let’s suppose you were raised to believe you should never ever drink dr. pepper.  You might reach a point where you’d say “I know you were taught that, but there’s no reason…”
R:yeah.  I don’t really know.
I:So if you had to back it all the way up to sort of the ultimate basis for things, where you would go is to…god?  The bible?
R:Yeah.
I:Cause some people would say, that’s not it, that’s wrong, I mean, all it is is say, consequences, if somethin’ hurts somebody, then it’s wrong, but it has nothin’ to do with the ten commandments.
R:Yeah.
I:What do you think of that?
R:I mean if it’s wrong, you know it’s wrong, or at least you should know it’s wrong.  I just, I mean, conscious-wise, you shouldn’t be able to do it and it not just tear you up.

I:Okay.
R:And it’s all the bad stuff you hear about, you never hear about the guy that did this, did this good, or helped this person.  All you hear about is the person that robbed this or destroyed this or whatever.

R:A lot of people, yes.

You could just tell, I mean they would talk to you, tell you what was goin’ on.  You’d stand there and talk to somebody for an hour or better.

You could just tell, I mean they would talk to you, tell you what was goin’ on.  You’d stand there and talk to somebody for an hour or better.  And then some of ‘em would just come in there and they’d catch you with your back turned and their buddy would come up there and talk to you, keep you busy, they’d go back there and get what they wanted and leave, and that was just…","The respondent primarily makes decisions based on the moral teachings instilled by their parents, emphasizing a clear distinction between right and wrong, which is influenced by their upbringing and religious beliefs, particularly the Ten Commandments, while also expressing a desire to enjoy life and help others when in need.","I:How do you normally decide or know what is good or bad, or wrong or right in life?  How do you go about figuring out moral things?
R:What do you mean, by like, at this point now, it’s just like “‘Hey, let’s do this!’ ‘Dude, that’s not right, we shouldn’t be doing that.’”  It’s almost like “Hey, I could do this or do this…well this is wrong.” It’s kind of learned through development of you know, 22 years of stuff, and the way my beliefs are and the way I was raised and stuff like that.  “This is right, this is wrong.”
I:So you have a pretty clear sense of what’s right and wrong?
R:Fairly well.  Most of the time.
I:And so it sounds like sort of moral decision making and moral knowledge is pretty straightforward?
R:Pretty cut and dry.  It just comes naturally, I guess, it could be best put.
I:What is it do you think that makes something right or wrong?
R:Outside of what the rules are…
I:I mean really right or wrong, not just the law.
R:It goes back like I said to how you were raised, the morals you were raised with, stuff like that.
I:But some people, but people are raised all different.  Does that mean morality is all different?
R:Yeah, I think…
I:If somebody was raised in a completely different wacko family and they taught them “Steal and beat people up,” that would be right?
R:In their minds.
I:What about in reality?
R:It’s not, no, it’s not in reality.
I:Are there things in reality that are right or wrong no matter what anybody thinks about them?
R:I would guess so.  Well, I … That’s a really good question.  I mean, there’s no claims well like murder and stuff come to mind, but then again, when you think about some of these other countries, it’s not…, I really don’t know how to answer that.  I really don’t.","What do you mean, by like, at this point now, it’s just like “‘Hey, let’s do this!’ ‘Dude, that’s not right, we shouldn’t be doing that.’”  It’s almost like “Hey, I could do this or do this…well this is wrong.” It’s kind of learned through development of you know, 22 years of stuff, and the way my beliefs are and the way I was raised and stuff like that.  “This is right, this is wrong.” Fairly well.

You know, the Ten Commandments, and things like that. yeah, I mean there’s that’s just kind of the roll of the dice that is Life. Mostly likely.  That could be the right thing.  That could be the wrong thing, it’s like, I once read a quote in regards to religion that said “I’d rather live my life if there is a God, then die and find out there isn’t, then to live like there isn’t a God and find out there is.” And that’s kind of the way I take it. I mean I believe it, I’m not like “Well, maybe, maybe not,” but one of my co-workers thinks the Bible’s a fairy tale.  And he was raised in  really devout, Baptist family, I guess but to this day, he’s 30 years old and he’ll look at you and he’ll tell you it’s all a bunch of crap.  And I’m like, “Ok, Ray*!” No, I disagree completely, 100%.  I’m like, “Ok, Ray*!  That’s your thing, but have fun with that later on man!”","The respondent prioritizes paying off debts and saving when receiving a windfall, bases their moral understanding on upbringing and personal beliefs, acknowledges the relativity of morality influenced by societal changes, emphasizes the importance of helping others as a Christian duty, and values the advice of parents or teachers over personal gain or happiness when faced with moral dilemmas."

R:Mm,--
I:Or how did you get to that perspective?
R:Well I think a lot of it was the school debacle that I mentioned.  I just kind of got to see an interesting view of people that I hadn’t seen before.
I:Can you describe that some more, what, what side of people you saw?
R:Well just more the selfish angle, you know they didn’t have to do what is in their job description just because.  It made things easier for them.
I:So, they sort of sacrificed what was good for you just out of laziness—
R:For their own interests, yeah.
I:--or whatever, like that.  And so that caused you to see something that sort of shaped this way of thinking about morality?
R:Probably.
I:Mm-mm.  But did you, did you, did you think that way before then and that only solidified it or did that—
R:I think so.
I:--really sort of change your thinking.
R:I generally had a rather cynical outlook of life in general.
I:Would you say your parents have the same sort of cynical outlook?
R:Not really.
I:Why do you call it cynical, you might as well just call it realistic.
R:Well yeah, I think it was Oscar Wilde that said that um, the power of good observation is called cynicism by people who don’t have it.
I:Okay, um, so once I was hiking, this is a true story, once I was hiking in um, the Andes mountains and I got on a path that was much bigger and harder and longer that I expected it to be and was, what would people would normally call dying of thirst, I wasn’t about to die, but and I ran across this Australian with a canteen of water.  Well, let’s suppose I had got an impulse and said, well look, I’m really thirsty and this, I’m dehydrated, whatever.
R:And you look okay, gimmee!
I:Yeah, what if um, and what if I knew that there was nobody anywhere around, what if I would have just shoved him over a cliff and taken his water.  That would just be too bad for him.  There’s nothing immoral about that.
R:Yeah, probably.
I:There’s nothing morally?
R:I mean it probably wasn’t very nice and that there were possible alternatives.
I:Well let’s suppose I said, can I have some of your water and he said no.
R:Yeah.
I:Bug off, bloke .
R:Yeah .
I:Let’s suppose there were no alternatives, let’s suppose that was it.
R:Well you couldn’t just knock him down, versus off the cliff, because then you rather risk that the canteen will go off with it
I:Let’s suppose, let’s suppose he put his canteen down.
R:Okay.
I:I don’t know, I don’t know how to construct,--
R:Yeah, I, I understand what you meant 00:21:14
I:What I’m trying to get at is, well even if I had an easier alternative, what, what’s wrong with killing him, it just makes it simpler to get away, I don’t have to fight with him.
R:Yeah this is true.
I:There’s nothing wrong with that, I would never get caught, I would have my water.
R:Yeah.
I:Is there a problem with that?
R:Well again, it depends on your outlook but it wouldn’t be very nice, obviously.  But.
I:But depending on your outlook, nice could be irrelevant.
R:Yeah, just.
I:So but the outlook I’m pushing here is.
R:You just saw him and immediately didn’t like it, it’s not my problem.
I:But I’m saying if, if we take seriously this view of morality we couldn’t make a judgment that that was wrong.  In the strong sense of wrong, or immoral or that I would have to—
R:Right.
I:It’s just society would have discouraged it and punished me but society didn’t catch me so it was too bad for the Australian to be on the mountain with water.
R:Right, mm-mm, and I think a lot of it is society’s pressure to make you think what’s moral and what’s not.
I:So is it a correct implication of what you’re saying then that, um,--
R:Well I think it’s—
I:Most people act morally because society is set up to get them to do that.
R:Because of the peer pressure of society, yeah.
I:Why does society get them to do that, what does society?
R:Why does society do anything, I mean, you, you look around, I always thought it was rather wacky myself, but.
I:But people seem to have an interest in maintaining a certain order and getting people to behave in a certain way, why do you, why don’t, why don’t they just all realize, hey it’s those strong winds and—
R:I think it would be very interesting if we did but I think it’s not likely to happen just because of the peer pressure issue.
I:But peer pressure is driven by what you think is right or wrong and good and bad and so if people’s views of that change, then.
R:Well I mean, see now I would have said peer pressure is what other people think is good and bad,--
I:Yeah, that’s what I mean.
R:And make you think what is good and bad, yeah.
I:Have you ever read Friedrich Nitche, the german philosopher?
R:I have never, no.
I:Yeah, yeah I mean he basically said, look, we don’t believe in God anymore, God is dead, it God is dead then all things are permissible and this whole notion of human rights and dignity and taking care of the weak is BS, the strong should be triumphant and conquer the weak and it’s, and that’s beautiful.
R:Yeah I would probably roughly agree with that.
I:If birds of prey fly off with little lambs and tear them to shreds then that’s the way it is.  So you would go along with that.
R:Mm-mm, and there’s not a lot we can do about it, yeah.
I:Okay, and you’re comfortable living in that kind of universe?
R:I think so.
I:And so how do you make sense of this is a very interesting conversation.
R:Oh thank you.
I:How do you make sense of um, like say the Nazis in the thirties, I mean it was socially defined then, Jews are bad, we’re gonna get rid of them.
R:Yeah, it’s the way they thought.
I:And so do we stand in a position to condemn them or we just said that was a different time and place and that’s just the way it was.
R:Well yeah, you can’t necessarily make comparisons of different time periods just because there was an entirely different mindset.
I:So people that fought them and said this is the wrong mindset, even though they fought a losing battle, um, they were just wasting their time, waste, being naïve, they were, no basis for fighting the Nazis?
R:Well it did, they thought that, I don’t know if they thought that they could actually change their outlook and if by killing them changes their outlook it served your purpose, that’s one less person who is going to terrorize you with that anymore.
I:Okay do you think the logical conclusion of this view of things is life is a war of interest groups against all, and it’s just a quest for power, basically to dominate other…?
R:Probably, yeah.
I:And would you say, is that sad or is that just, there’s nothing to be sad about because it’s just the way it is?
R:I would have said it was just the way it was and chances are it isn’t going to change anytime soon.","I’ve, I’ve always kind of had this philosophy that there are only ever two reasons anybody does anything. Is to avoid pain or gain some pleasure. Yeah.  Very pragmatic. Well if, if it was what they believe and if they really want it, you know, in their own way they’re bringing it about. If, if they think that it will make a difference. Well I mean, as you say not very anymore, people they, they don’t, if they, if someone martyrs it becomes news and they, they’ve done, got their message out by doing so. Yeah. Almost certainly. Mm,-- Well I think a lot of it was the school debacle that I mentioned.  I just kind of got to see an interesting view of people that I hadn’t seen before.

I have some questions about morality.  Right, wrong, just, unjust, etc., etc.  Um, tell me how you think about this subject.  What is it that makes things right or wrong, how do you think about morality?
R:Well I think a lot of it is that there ought to be intuitive, you know, killing people is wrong, hurting people is wrong, just because, it’s just, you know doing things that cause discomfort to other people is just not something that I think is a good thing for anybody to do.  But, I don’t know, that I have a whole overarching philosophy about it.
I:But you’re instinct or your intuition is that things that hurt others is wrong?
R:Pretty much.
I:Okay.  Um, why is that wrong?
R:Well just because, I mean causing harm to other people is just not something that anybody should do and you know, being harmed in serious ways is something that anybody should have to put up with.
I:But why?
R:Just because it’s just an uncomfortable experience.  It’s not good for anyone really.
I:What uh, let me play devil’s advocate.  What if, who cares about other people, what if I said, what if somebody said, well of course you don’t want to be uncomfortable, you don’t want to suffer, but if somebody else does, it’s not your problem.
R:Well maybe it’s not, maybe you shouldn’t have to think about it at all.  I mean it does seem like a lot of the reasons the world is the way it is now is because of that attitude.
I:And the way that it is now is,
R:Just, strife with horrible things.
I:So people had that attitude less, the world would improve to a better place?
R:Probably in small ways.
I:Why not um,
R:You know, it’s the all about me attitude, that has also caused many people to become zillionaires and M11:Well, see that’s the thing, is pretty much all attitudes can be rationalized to be you know, understandable, it’s, I don’t know whether it’s moral or not is an entirely separate question.
I:So,
R:Cause whether something makes sense and whether it’s moral are just not even in the same,
I:So is there something that makes things moral or is that just something we call something that we want to believe?  I mean moral in the sense of right or wrong regardless of how somebody thinks of it that way?
R:Yeah.  Yeah.  I don’t know.  I mean, you know, there were entire weeks of philosophy where someone tried to tell us, but there were never really one theory that I ascribed to over another.
I:Do you have a pretty clear sense of what’s morally right or wrong, or is it not that clear to you?
R:Well there’s always fuzzy boundaries in anything but, no I think in most situations I could just pick a side.  But then I think that almost anyone could do that, maybe fairly similar.
I:Earlier you said sort of intuition.  Would you say that the way you sort of view things is that people in their guts sort of know things, or they should,
R:Yeah, if they’re not psychotic in any way, probably.  It’s just whether people choose to follow that is their personal,
I:And that intuition comes from, sort of evolutionary development, or, or universal human something or?
R:I don’t know.
I:Okay.  Um, some teens I talk to say that the thing that makes something wrong is it’s consequences, it’s not that something’s right or wrong in itself, it’s that if it produces something bad or unpleasant.  Is that how you think about it, I mean you did talk about people shouldn’t suffer,
R:Yeah.  I don’t really know, I just, no, I don’t have cause to think about it much.
I:So this is not a particularly pressing,
R:No.","Well there’s always fuzzy boundaries in anything but, no I think in most situations I could just pick a side.  But then I think that almost anyone could do that, maybe fairly similar.

Do you even think there are things that are right or wrong?
R:I don’t know if I think in terms so much of right or wrong as things that you wouldn’t like them if they happened to you.  Well no, that’s not true.  You can look at something and say that is just… Well, it’s interesting you say that.  I don’t think in terms of this is wrong so much as that’s just not right.  I guess there is a lot of the, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” kind of thing.
I:Do you believe that is eternal maxim?
R:I do.  I don’t you know, repeat it in the back of my head everyday.
I:Why do you think that’s the case?   That that’s the general, rule-of-thumb to live by?  Why is it the case that that’s true?
R:Well I saw a poster once and it was basically that phrase in this kind of like sunflower shaped thing and on every petal was basically that phrase in various different religious books.  I guess it’s just one of those things.  You’d like for people to be nice to you.  You’d like for people to be forthright with you because the world is a very unpleasant place if you don’t.  It seems only fair I guess.
I:So it’s kind of an ?  Like I’m willing to behave in a certain way that puts demands on me in the expectation that other people should and hopefully will and then we’ll all have a nicer life together?
R:Pretty much.
I:It’s kind of a social contract theory.
R:I mean, they won’t necessarily, but you can give it a try.
I:That was my next question.  What about the people that are the proverbial assholes?
R:There are those people.  I talk to them on the phone everyday.
I:So they don’t play by that system.  They drag everyone else down.
R:Yeah.
I:So you’re doing work that they’re not being kind on.  What about them?  Does that mean that the system is still worth doing?
R:I don’t know that it really bothers me just because I have this code of conduct and I like it.  I don’t care if you don’t like it or don’t follow it.  It’s actually one of those about the insurance industry.  I’m a claims assistant so don’t make any decisions.  I could go be a claims examiner, but I don’t feel like I could emotionally in good conscious do that to people.  I couldn’t tell them, “You fell on the sidewalk instead of the parking lot so we’re not going to pay your twenty-thousand dollar hospital bill.”  I couldn’t tell people that.  In the insurance industry you could be like a bad guy.  There’s people and they call you and like an 80 year-old man who needs his inhaler and I can’t authorize it.  And it’s like, “Not cool man.  Bad day for you,” and I sometimes come home feeling horrible about that.
I:You mentioned this poster.  Did you already believe this general orientation before you saw the poster?  Did the poster just kind of solidify it for you?  So what is the role of the poster in the formation of-?
R:-It’s not really very important.  It was just one of the things when I think of that phrase I have a tendency to think about it because that’s really interesting and there’s a lot of people that do have respect for religion and look at all these religions that say basically exactly the same thing about this particular subject.
I:So even though you describe yourself as a hardcore atheist, the fact that other people sort of share that outlook from a religious perspective you view as “I could take that.”?
R:I view it as a thing you can do if you want to and it won’t hurt me in anyway.
I:And if people want to do something totally different?  Like, “I look out for myself.  I’ll be nice if it’s good for me and if not, I won’t be.  And that’s just the way it’s been and it’s the way it’s ever been”?
R:Yeah, pretty much.
I:There isn’t any sort of larger moral truth to appeal and to say, “Well that’s wrong.  We need to change in order to be more like this truth”?
R:I don’t really think so because you can’t have an independent arbor of those kind of things and if there’s nobody that can make that decision then… if there is literally nobody that can make that decision then it’s not necessarily a decision to be made.
I:When it comes to certain things the government tries to do that.  It doesn’t get too much involved in morality, but it certainly says, “Here’s how you’ll behave.  At this age you can and can’t do this” etc, etc, which has a lot of moral ramifications so at the very least you could say, “Well it’s legal.”  Then what’s the explanation of why something is legal or not legal?","I don’t know if I think in terms so much of right or wrong as things that you wouldn’t like them if they happened to you.  Well no, that’s not true.  You can look at something and say that is just… Well, it’s interesting you say that.  I don’t think in terms of this is wrong so much as that’s just not right.  I guess there is a lot of the, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” kind of thing. I do.  I don’t you know, repeat it in the back of my head everyday. Well I saw a poster once and it was basically that phrase in this kind of like sunflower shaped thing and on every petal was basically that phrase in various different religious books.  I guess it’s just one of those things.  You’d like for people to be nice to you.  You’d like for people to be forthright with you because the world is a very unpleasant place if you don’t.  It seems only fair I guess. Pretty much. I mean, they won’t necessarily, but you can give it a try. There are those people.  I talk to them on the phone everyday. Yeah. I don’t know that it really bothers me just because I have this code of conduct and I like it.  I don’t care if you don’t like it or don’t follow it.  It’s actually one of those about the insurance industry.  I’m a claims assistant so don’t make any decisions.  I could go be a claims examiner, but I don’t feel like I could emotionally in good conscious do that to people.  I couldn’t tell them, “You fell on the sidewalk instead of the parking lot so we’re not going to pay your twenty-thousand dollar hospital bill.”  I couldn’t tell people that.  In the insurance industry you could be like a bad guy.  There’s people and they call you and like an 80 year-old man who needs his inhaler and I can’t authorize it.  And it’s like, “Not cool man.  Bad day for you,” and I sometimes come home feeling horrible about that. -It’s not really very important.  It was just one of the things when I think of that phrase I have a tendency to think about it because that’s really interesting and there’s a lot of people that do have respect for religion and look at all these religions that say basically exactly the same thing about this particular subject. I view it as a thing you can do if you want to and it won’t hurt me in anyway. Yeah, pretty much. I don’t really think so because you can’t have an independent arbor of those kind of things and if there’s nobody that can make that decision then… if there is literally nobody that can make that decision then it’s not necessarily a decision to be made.","The respondent would use a hypothetical inheritance of $100,000 primarily to buy a reliable car and help a significant other with debt, emphasizing a sense of responsibility and honor in their relationship, while also reflecting on their tendency to feel overwhelmed by personal issues and the importance of treating others well, guided by a ""do unto others"" principle rather than strict moral obligations."

R:I know it’s wrong because um, the reason I know stealing is wrong is because of like when I, when I was littler I used to take stuff from my Mom and Dad, then they chewed me out and I learned from that.  So I learned, I figured that out the hard way.
I:Like where, where do your own views of right and wrong come from like?
R:My own views?
I:Yeah.  Like where do your views of right and wrong come from, like how do you learn what’s right and wrong.
R:The right and wrong?  Like I, well what I said, when I was little I used to take stuff, but then I got a spanking for it.
I:Uh-huh
R:And that’s how I learned.
I:Like from your parents training you and punishing you?
R:Yeah.
I:So can you, can you give me some specific examples of like when you need to, when you have to decide what’s right and wrong given a situation?
R:Like I know this isn’t a real big deal, but like taking pencils from someone when you know that’s theirs and not giving it back.  I think that’s, I, I do it myself but then I give the pencil right back, but then like if, like one of my teachers, he buys about 10 packs of pencils, #2 pencils and people take them.
I:Uh-huh
R:I think that’s just wasting the school’s mon—the teacher’s money cause then every week he goes out and guys new pencils for us.  For tests and stuff, well then they still end up getting taken.
I:So do you think, do you think that would be wrong because, because it was wasting the school’s money or because it’s taking something that’s somebody else’s, like what do you think, what, what do you think is it that makes it—
R:I think it’s wrong because it, because it’s wasting the school’s money. Cause pencils for school aren’t very, aren’t that cheap.
I:And so it’s more, they’re kind of like stealing money from the school in that way.  Yeah, I gotcha.
R:I think that’s all it’s gonna do is just get you into more trouble.
I:Mm-mm.
R:Cause what happens if one of the kids caught you taking it and then they went and told the teacher.  You’d, anyway, that the teacher would find out yet, still.  But like if someone took the pencil and um, and no one caught them.
I:Uh-huh
R:That’s still a pretty, that’s still wrong.
I:Even though no one found out.
R:Yeah.","Just the many years I’ve been around, I should know.  And what’s like right and wrong, like stealing, like if I were to steal this thing right here, I know that would be wrong.  Then if I were to give it back and tell that I took it I knew that would be the proper thing to do.

R:How do you decide it?
I:How do you decide or how do you know what is good and what’s bad?
R:Uh, by mistakes that we, by mistakes that I’ve did in my past.  I’ve corrected myself from it.
I:Can you tell me an example of one that’s happened?
R:Uh, I’m thinking.  Doing dishes, like because I never used to be able to get dishes clean, and now like I’m getting them clean after my parents told me to work harder at it, spend more time and now I get them clean because I spend too much time at doing dishes.  I usually spend about a half hour at the sink just doing them, like a couple pots and pans.
I:Why?
R:Well, I like playing in the water so.
I:In general, do you think you have a hard time or an easy time deciding what’s right and what’s wrong?
R:Easy time.
I:Why?
R:Because my parents have directed me in the right way and I have no problem with that.
I:Do you have any idea of what it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Do I have an idea of what makes something right or wrong?
I:Yeah, what makes something right and something else wrong?
R:Well, if you steal stuff, that’s not right.
I:Why?
R:I don’t know.  Well, I guess because if you didn’t pay for it—
I:So.
R:I have no idea how to answer that question.
I:Where to you think you’ve got how you understand right and wrong?  Where did you come up with these things?
R:Understanding right from—
I:The things that you just told me, where’d you come up with that?
R:Uh, because, like on a trip that we take to New Mexico every year, people in the winter, it took us five hours to get out of Michigan in time because someone didn’t obey the law and then we caught people stealing and then we’ve also caught, we’ve heard shootings going off.
I:Where?
R:Like where there’s not so many cops like, at the top of the mountain in Alma Gorda.
I:New Mexico?
R:Yeah, in New Mexico, they have like shootings up at the top of the mountain.
I:Why?
R:Because, I don’t know.
I:So but like, you talk about the speed limit and gun laws, I mean, how did you come to decide that those things are good?  I mean, who told you or where did you get your sense of right and wrong?

I:Anywhere else?
R:My grandparents.","How do you decide it? Uh, by mistakes that we, by mistakes that I’ve did in my past.  I’ve corrected myself from it. Uh, I’m thinking.

How do you normally decide what’s good or bad or right or wrong in life?
R:mmm… well, my parents are right there… on me most of the time.
I:So they make sure you know or…?
R:Yeah, there’s some things I just get in trouble for at home cuz, either I don’t do it or, well, yeah, I just didn’t do it so, that’s basically the only thing I get in trouble for, is not doing it .
I:But in general do you find it easy or hard to decide what is right and wrong?  Are there things you struggle with?
R:There’s things I struggle with but… it’s… it’s just common sense, whether you should do it or not.
I:Do you think this has gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years? Or is it…
R:I think it’s gotten easier, but…like I said, I’m a senior this year, graduating, and these last two weeks have been just…off the wall, because… things going on at home, trying to get caught up in school and… our whole house is…just…it feels cluttered, just about.
I:Like with things to do, or with people around?
R:With things to do. And, it…honestly I can’t wait till I graduate because that will give…that will get that off the mind, and I don’t have to worry about other things to do.
I:Ok. What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong? What is it about something that… ?
R:Uh… that makes something right or wrong?
I:Yeah, like I mean, is it like maybe the consequences? Is it, you know, if it’s good results then it’s Ok? Or whether you feel right about it or… are there rules, laws?
R:To me it is more feeling right about doin it. And then also again it has to do with the laws. Like I said, there’s a lot of things I wouldn’t do.
I:Like what?
R:Like smoking. I know it’s not against the law but, it’s…it’s for my personal health. I don’t wanna die in 10 years, so… And then, drunk driving I would never do because I lost a friend to it. So, that’s taught me not to drink and drive. So…
I:So it’s your experience that…
R:Yeah.
I:Ok. Where have your moral views come from?
R:Probably just experiences. I don’t know if that really answers your question, but…
I:It does I guess, but are there particular, I don’t know…you say your parents are one influence? And you mentioned that you are a Lutheran a little while ago. So, how do those things affect your sense of morality?
R:Uh,… um, I really don’t know about how the religion comes into it. But, I know in the Bible it says that God gave up his son to… he died for us to forgive our sins. And basically, what that means to me is that if we die and we did, like, a bunch of things wrong, we’re still going to go up to heaven. To me, basically, if you did one thing wrong that you regret, and you die like the next day or something, you’re going to go to heaven no matter what. Because it’s all behind you.
I:Well, why would you do anything right then? Why not just do wrong things?
R:Ah, , no, I understand what you’re saying. It’s… I don’t know… it’s just how, like, kids are raised by their parents, depending on what they do in their life, whether they make the right choices or wrong choices. See for drunk drivers…kids that drink, they grew up with it; they might have grown up around it. So… it…that basically tells them, ‘oh it’s Ok to drink.’ So, for my friend that smokes, he grew up around smoking so, he thinks it’s Ok to smoke. So…
I:But I mean, can you decide on the outside? You can say that even though these people grew up drinking, they shouldn’t be drinking and driving right? Like you want to tell your friends that right?
R:Yeah.
I:Why do you think that’s right for everybody?
R:I don’t know.. .. I guess I’m more of a person that likes to see people live to the full extent, to succeed in life.
I:So there’s some things that will allow you to live fully and other things that will destroy you?

R:well, religion helps. You know, I mean, and then there’s just, there’s like an ingrained sense of right and wrong I feel in most balanced people, I think.
I:is it easy or hard for you to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:it’s usually pretty straight forward but sometimes even if you know it’s wrong it doesn’t make a difference in your decision.
I:so in terms of knowing what’s right and wrong you’ve got a pretty good sense?

I:what particular decision or types of decisions that have gotten harder?
R:well, I don’t know. I don’t know.
I:so you’ve got a pretty clear idea about that. And is there something about what makes something right or wrong, some kind of principle? Like how do you know what’s right or wrong, if you were trying to tell somebody, you shouldn’t do this, you shouldn’t do that?
R:sometimes it’s hard to relate because they didn’t grow up with the background you did or whatever, so I don’t know how you would get it across without seeming like some sort of bigot, most of the time.
I:so it would be hard to appeal to them.
R:yeah.
I:but if you could, if they were the same religion you’re saying then you could tell them?
R:usually.
I:okay. So you can tell, you know right or wrong because you have a religious basis for your belief.
R:yeah.
I:and anything else, consequences, feelings, conscience?
R:no.
I:and then your moral views, if you had to kind of pinpoint where you acquired your moral views or what’s been most influential on your understanding of right and wrong, what would you say?
R:parents and church, yeah.
I:not really experience so much?
R:I try to know what’s right or wrong before I have to experience it, you know?","well, religion helps. You know, I mean, and then there’s just, there’s like an ingrained sense of right and wrong I feel in most balanced people, I think. it’s usually pretty straight forward but sometimes even if you know it’s wrong it doesn’t make a difference in your decision. yeah. I don’t know, not harder. I don’t know, maybe a little bit. well, I don’t know. I don’t know.  sometimes it’s hard to relate because they didn’t grow up with the background you did or whatever, so I don’t know how you would get it across without seeming like some sort of bigot, most of the time. yeah. usually. yeah. no.  parents and church, yeah. I try to know what’s right or wrong before I have to experience it, you know?","The respondent emphasizes the importance of making money work for future security and charitable giving, while also highlighting that their moral compass is influenced by religion and parents, believing in a clear distinction between right and wrong despite societal complexities.",,,

R:Um…my church, my parents, my brothers, all my brothers and sisters.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um…how you’ve been taught.  Your understanding of the view of how it’s supposed to be.
I:Okay, can you give me an example of something that’s been taught…something, just one example?
R:Um, that you’re like not supposed to smoke or like have any drugs cause it’s harmful to you.
I:Okay, what if a person was taught by their parents that smoking was okay, what would you think of their morality, would that be okay for them to do if they were taught that?
R:Well that’s kind of the parents fault.  Cause they were taught by their parents and so, what you’re having an example to follow, you tend to follow.
I:So what if the parents, that’s their morality too, and part of their morality is that smoking is okay, is that not an acceptable morality for them?
R:No, they should know better because they are older and they should try to be a good example.
I:Okay, if people could be taught different examples, by their parents, by their churches, by their families, things like that, what is it that really makes something right or wrong, like in a sense, like how would you tell what, which of those teachings were actually right, and which were less right and wrong.
R:Kind of what you know and what you understand it to be and what you feel how it is, if it’s right or wrong.
I:What if people feel different?  What if some people feel, I don’t know, smoking is okay and others feel that smoking is not okay?
R:Well they don’t kind of have the full picture of what it’s supposed to be cause there’s rulings on how it’s unhealthy for you. M8:They don’t understand how life works, and what you’re supposed to do M8:and how you’re supposed to educate yourself to become the best you can be M8:to help others than yourself.
I:M8:Why is it important to help others?
R:M8:Because it’s just not right to concentrate on you alone, but to also help M8:others, giving and understanding others as well.
I:M8:What if someone didn’t care about others, they only cared about M8:themselves?
R:M8:Then they don’t feel, they’ll probably feel guilty, cause they don’t, M8:they’re just being selfish and not sharing how they are happy with those M8:who are less fortunate.
I:It probably sounds like I’m beating a dead horse, but I really want to understand this, so if a person wants to go talk to their parents, let’s say that they’re rich, they’re life is going to be all set by what they do.  Um…and uh…they, their parents just teach them their whole life, you just have to look out for yourself.  Don’t worry about other people.  They’re taught that from the day their born, all the way up, they just think they don’t have to look out for other people, that’s what they’re taught, that’s the example they see in their family.  Would they be wrong, or would they like feel guilty.
R:Well, they wouldn’t know it’s wrong to do that, cause their examples would teach them that.  So it’s the responsibility of them that they teach them a good example.
I:So let’s say this person turned 18 or whatever and the become, they meet someone who has a different philosophy, they meet someone who thinks it is important to help people, and this friend of theirs is always talking about how it’s important to help other people, how would that person decide whether their friend was right or whether their parents were right?  How would they make that decision?
R:Just try to figure, ask people, so that they can understand if it’s okay just to concentrate on yourself or to help others, um, to help them become like you are.
I:So what if the more people they talk to that helping others was good, like 60% of the people said it was good to help others and 40% said it wasn’t then they should decide to help others?
R:Yeah.
I:What if, what if they ran into something that was the other way around? What if 60% said you shouldn’t help others and 40% said you should help others?  How would they make that…would that be right?
R:Well, it would by what they have as a resource to have what you have, how people are supposed to do things.
I:Okay, so do you think there is any way for people to know what’s right or wrong apart from what they learn from other people?
R:Only if they’re taught it, they have to be taught by examples and there aren’t  many examples today.
I:How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life personally?
R:What I feel is right and what other people have taught me and one I ask to see if they have any…direction to show.
I:What have been your most important influences in what you think of as right and wrong?
R:Um…my mother.
I:Why do you trust her to tell you what’s right and wrong?
R:Because she sort of, from my point of view looks at things from the right perspective, and it seems to go along with the perspective of other people I’ve seen and her life is happy, and they’re happier and so it seems that they’re doing what is right.
I:I have to ask you this, this might sound a little crazy, but let’s say an alien comes down from outer space and they only meet a couple people, and the people have totally different moralities, totally different, the world is just divided, what would happen, one half of the world is this you have to help people, and the other half thinks you should never help people, you should just look out for yourself.  How would this alien from outer space decide how, which one of these people are…cause on one half they were all taught it, the other half they were all taught it, and so they were raised that way they all trust it.  They all think their parents had the right perspective on things.  How would this person who sort of appeared out of nowhere, how would they choose which sort of camp to join?
R:Well they would kind of have to see which one has the better life and how they are.  Cause some people that don’t help others they just sort of feel, they want to be sort of secretive or they want to be just left alone.  And people that help others they kind of have a happier lifestyle, they are just easier to get along with, they’re nicer and they’re, just, great people.","Um…my church, my parents, my brothers, all my brothers and sisters.

R:How do know?
I:How do you decide, you know.
R:I think everybody knows what’s right and what’s wrong, it’s just whether they live by it or not.  So I think everybody has this same kind of moral standards, I think some might be different, but relatively speaking, I think everybody has some morals.  Whether or not they’re different or not.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:You mean like doing right and wrong?
I:Yeah.
R:I think it’s pretty easy to decide to do something good instead of something bad because, you know, if it’s something illegal, obviously, there’s always that you get caught or whatnot.  You get in trouble, you know, you don’t need to deal with that.  Then even if you  you know, you basically know you can get away with it, it’s just the fact you know ok, if someone did this to you, how would you feel?
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:I think it’s the same, same struggle really.  I mean, yeah, it’s certain areas, it’s gotten easier, but other areas, it’s gotten harder.
I:Like what areas?
R:More like areas  drugs, really that’s kind of gotten a little bit harder.  Because you know you shouldn’t.  Maybe you shouldn’t drink and drive, done it plenty of times.  But other than that, being good and whatnot, I think that’s easy, I think really, probably just alcohol and pot.  I could stop if I wanted to, but…
I:So what’s prevented you?
R:I don’t know, pot relaxes me, I smoke it and I just hang out.  I mean I don’t even really, I mean, we have fun we just chill.  It’s not like we’re out there, doing stupid things.  We just hang out.
I:Ok. What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know dude.  I think it’s just a feeling.
I:So, describe to me that feeling.
R:I don’t know, you just kind of know what’s right and what’s wrong just by like, well, if it’s illegal, it’s obviously you know what’s right and what’s wrong.  But, even just other things like sometimes I guess maybe you get guilt.  If you get guilt, obviously you’re knew something was wrong and you did something anyway.
I:Ok.  So feeling guilty?  And the laws of the state?  So are all of the laws, I mean, are they all morally justified, or correct?
R:I don’t know.  I’d say most of them, but one that I know isn’t right, is I don’t agree with affirmative action.  And I think I have it right, I’m not sure, but I know they give people of different races money to go to college.  Why can’t you give a white kid money to go to college?  He needs to know how to do something too, right?  That’s, I don’t know, it just…
I:So is that morally wrong, in your opinion?
R:Yeah.  It’s the same, it’s instead of being racist, it’s a reverse racist.  Either way, you’re still bringing somebody up and putting somebody else down.
I:Ok.  So what would be the morally right thing to do?
R:The morally right thing to do is if you’re going to give some people money, give everybody else money.  But if you can’t afford that, then don’t give anybody money, or make it somehow… give a chance at least to somebody, a white kid, to get money for college.  Don’t just give it to everybody else.
I:Ok.  Ok.   From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:I think mostly myself, but at the same time some from I guess from religion, some from I guess parents.  But, I think for me to actually pick my views, I mean, it has to come from me.
I:So, if I have different world views than you, but I choose them myself, am I justified?
R:Aww man.  No.
I:Why not?
R:I don’t know. No.  Are you?  I guess, I don’t know.  Let me think.
I:So hypothetically, what if I…
R:I mean, like yeah, like you get them from like law, some.  Some from the law and like others, you know, parents from teaching kids how to respect other adults, you know whether or not they’re your parent and you know them or not, you should still treat them with respect.  Now some, I think as long as they’re not really big issues, then if you have so morals are different than mine, but they’re not like really major or dramatic, or I guess, extremist, then I don’t really think it matters.","How do know?

And where do you think your own views of, how do you decide whether something is right or wrong, where do your views come from?
R:Um, my religion.  Um, a lot of it, a lot of my choice making and decisions is like, I see how it’s gonna affect me and how it’s gonna affect my ability to go to the temple some day or something like that, so a lot of it’s my religious beliefs.
I:Okay, so when you say that, you mean there are specific teachings that tell you what’s right or wrong, or that I mean, how is it that?
R:No, it’s all, not really, um, it just kind of like for me that’s just kind of like how I make my decisions or you know, that’s, mostly cause my, my religion, um, just cause yeah like, like a lot, probably like you said a lot of it is like the teachings, but not so much like in our, like Sunday they don’t tell us like you know this is right and that’s wrong, but it’s more like you know, you can choose cause you know, but.
I:Do you think it comes more from the people in your church or from the like the scriptures or from the religious, the church’s rules or where does it come from?
R:It’s, it’s all of it, it’s just, it’s all mixed together.
I:Okay.  And so do you think that um, like the things that you decide are right or wrong, I mean, like for example I mean the, you said that um, there’s certain things you’d have to do, you know certain choices we make so for instance stealing, you know if you, if you think stealing’s wrong, um, but what if somebody else says they think stealing’s okay, is it okay?
R:Well see that is like one of those standards things like stealing’s wrong for everyone.  And I don’t, it doesn’t, I mean, it, I don’t think it matters like who you are like, you know that’s wrong.
I:So where do you draw the line, how do you decide what things are right and wrong for everyone and what things people get to choose whether it’s right or wrong for them.
R:Um, like the bad, like things that are big like murdering someone, you know stealing or you know raping someone or like things like that.  I think that’s like where you draw the, well probably there’s like other things, those are just like the big things that I can think of that are wrong you know, for like just standard like, everyone knows their wrong for.
I:And why are those wrong for everyone?
R:Because, well—
I:Where does that come from?
R:Because  because like some things have happened to like my Mom, like she was raped and like my uncle, he’s in jail for raping and killing people, I don’t know, I just think that you know, I don’t think anybody should have to go through things like that and I just think it’s wrong for anyone to even consider it, I guess.
I:When did that happen to your Mom?
R:Oh when she was young, when she was like um, probably my age or a little younger, that’s why she spent a lot of time with her grandma.
I:Okay and so do you think that, is there um, I mean what, I know it’s, these questions might be pushing a little bit but we kind of wanna see, see what people think.
R:Oh, it’s okay.
I:But, but what is it that makes it wrong?
R:Um, what if—
I:Like if you were, if someone would say what’s the criteria by which I could, you know like I mean, say someone came to our society and had no concept of right and wrong or you know, they come from another planet, what’s the, how would they know, what’s the criteria by which they decide something’s wrong?
R:Um, how would they decide what’s right or wrong?
I:Yeah, I mean what, what things should I, if someone says I’m you know, I know nothing, I have no social knowledge.
R:
I:How do I know whether something, if I do this what, okay murder, well what makes that right or wrong, you know, how would I tell or how would I, does that make any sense?
R:Um.  It does make sense, I’m just thinking of how I can answer that. Um.
I:It’s a hard question and if you can’t answer it, that’s okay, I’m just, I’m curious what you think about what, what is it about that that makes it wrong.
R:Um, well, probably what is it about it, just I guess I would, I don’t really know, um, just doing it like um, like you’re gonna have to sit there and think about it you know and you’re gonna have to, I don’t know like if they plan or whatever, but um, you know you’re gonna have to have some thought on it and like what you’re gonna, I would think you know, you would have to think about it and everyone has a conscience and you would think that would affect them, but.
I:So is it just our conscience, like is, your, is there sort of some, some, something that, that tells us you know, something outside of ourselves that tells us it’s wrong, or is it just our conscience or is it the consequences of it?
R:I think it’s probably ourselves like, because some, like you can tell someone that’s wrong but like you said that doesn’t necessarily, they aren’t gonna say it’s wrong, but um, I think a lot of it has to do with your better judgment and um, a lot of just yeah.
I:So if a society decided, in our society we think it’s okay to kill people, is it okay, or is it still wrong, even if that society think it’s okay.
R:I think it, well personally I would think it would still be wrong, cause I, I just think that’s still wrong.","Um, my religion.  Um, a lot of it, a lot of my choice making and decisions is like, I see how it’s gonna affect me and how it’s gonna affect my ability to go to the temple some day or something like that, so a lot of it’s my religious beliefs. No, it’s all, not really, um, it just kind of like for me that’s just kind of like how I make my decisions or you know, that’s, mostly cause my, my religion, um, just cause yeah like, like a lot, probably like you said a lot of it is like the teachings, but not so much like in our, like Sunday they don’t tell us like you know this is right and that’s wrong, but it’s more like you know, you can choose cause you know, but. It’s, it’s all of it, it’s just, it’s all mixed together. Well see that is like one of those standards things like stealing’s wrong for everyone.  And I don’t, it doesn’t, I mean, it, I don’t think it matters like who you are like, you know that’s wrong. Um, like the bad, like things that are big like murdering someone, you know stealing or you know raping someone or like things like that.  I think that’s like where you draw the, well probably there’s like other things, those are just like the big things that I can think of that are wrong you know, for like just standard like, everyone knows their wrong for. Because, well— Because  because like some things have happened to like my Mom, like she was raped and like my uncle, he’s in jail for raping and killing people, I don’t know, I just think that you know, I don’t think anybody should have to go through things like that and I just think it’s wrong for anyone to even consider it, I guess. Oh when she was young, when she was like um, probably my age or a little younger, that’s why she spent a lot of time with her grandma. Oh, it’s okay. Um, what if— Um, how would they decide what’s right or wrong?  Um.  It does make sense, I’m just thinking of how I can answer that. Um. Um, well, probably what is it about it, just I guess I would, I don’t really know, um, just doing it like um, like you’re gonna have to sit there and think about it you know and you’re gonna have to, I don’t know like if they plan or whatever, but um, you know you’re gonna have to have some thought on it and like what you’re gonna, I would think you know, you would have to think about it and everyone has a conscience and you would think that would affect them, but. I think it’s probably ourselves like, because some, like you can tell someone that’s wrong but like you said that doesn’t necessarily, they aren’t gonna say it’s wrong, but um, I think a lot of it has to do with your better judgment and um, a lot of just yeah. I think it, well personally I would think it would still be wrong, cause I, I just think that’s still wrong.","The respondent primarily bases their decisions of right and wrong on their religious beliefs, which guide them to view certain actions, like stealing and murder, as universally wrong, while also acknowledging the influence of social pressures from friends and the consequences of their actions, such as feeling guilty after drinking alcohol.","I:Okay.  How do you decide or know what is good and bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:Um, I just, I don’t know.  Like, I, a lot of it, I base off my religion.  Because I believe in my religion with all my heart, so, if it does, if it like is bad, like the drinking and stuff like that, well that’s just common sense for me, like a lot of the stuff is just common sense, but like when it comes to like tough things, then I’ll just like compare it to my religion and if it like it goes against it, then I know it’s wrong or it’s bad, but if it doesn’t, then I know it’s right and it’s okay.
I:Is it pretty easy or is it difficult for you to figure out if something is right or wrong?
R:It’s pretty easy.
I:Yeah, so, has it gotten easier or harder of the last couple years?
R:Um, since I kind of started, well since like I got, I drank and lost my virginity, things like that, um, those things are like hard, I was like oh, that’s okay, you know I can do it once, even though I knew it was wrong at the time, but I just wanted to do it, but now I look back and I’m just like, oh, so stupid, because I know it was wrong.
I:So, maybe things have gotten a little more complex, or?
R:Yeah.
I:Good.  Um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:What did, what?
I:What makes something right or wrong?  Like what’s the criteria for whether something is right or wrong?
R:I don’t know, just what you feel, I guess?  If you feel that it’s wrong, you know, or, just, I don’t know, really.
I:So you said, you base a lot of things off your religion, so, is there something that you would say would be criteria within your religion that makes something right or wrong?
R:We don’t really have a criteria, just like the things we’re taught, you know, like it’s not like here, this is the criteria for, if this sounds like this, then you know it’s wrong, you know, it’s just really like, if we feel it’s wrong or if something we’ve been taught is you know, it’s different, than that’s really all.
I:Do you think it has anything to do with like, um, consequences or just how it feels or the laws or?
R:Oh, it has a lot to—probably all of it.  You know?  Like a law has like consequences because I mean, everything you do has consequences!    I don’t, you don’t have to be religious to know that!  But a lot of it is like consequences and how you feel and it’s a lot, it’s a little bit of everything, really.
I:Okay, so if something has bad consequences, does that make it wrong?
R:No.
I:No.
R:No.
I:Okay.  So, are there any actions that you think are always wrong?
R:I think like when guys hit girls, I think that will always be wrong.  Um, like stealing and stuff like that, that will always be wrong.
I:Okay.  and what makes those things wrong?
R:Um, well, theft is just like, I don’t know, I think that’s, that is wrong, because you’re stealing, I mean, I don’t know.  It depends, like anything, you steal anything, I mean, someone could have like got that from a gramma that passed away or someone could have put a lot of money into that or something you know, it could be valuable or something you know, just wrong, why?  And then, like, the only reason why I say like guys hitting girls is because my brother hits his girlfriend all the time, and I can’t stand it.  And um, that’s wrong because guys should never lay their hands on girls, like.
I:Is this the 16 year old?
R:Yeah.  Yeah, so he’s pretty bad.
I:Have you ever talked to him about it, or?
R:Yeah, but he is always like I just get so angry, I don’t know what to do, and, so, but.
I:Does she ever do anything about it?
R:She’s stupid and she stays with him and she allows it, pretty much, like she doesn’t, I mean, if a guy is gonna hit me, you’re not gonna hit me again.  Like you’re never gonna see me again, but she gets hit repeatedly, they’ve been together like a year, and I’ve just been there two months at my Dad’s and I’ve seen him like just like hit her, hit her, hit her and like one time it woke me up, from sleeping, he slapped her so hard and so she, and she’s stupid, she’s absolutely, I think any girl that stays with a guy that’s gonna hit him is absolutely stupid.  So.
I:Okay.  Have you ever talked to her about it?
R:Yeah, but she’s just like, I don’t know what to do.  She’s two-faced.  Like she’ll tell us she doesn’t want to be with him but then she’ll say, I want to be with him and then he’ll ask us what she says and we’re like she doesn’t want to be with you and then it just turns into oh my gosh, so much drama.","Um, I just, I don’t know.

R:Well, like, um, I wouldn’t do anything too illegal but you know, I I don’t have problems doing underage drinking, I go, I’m a college student that’s really not, that’s not a big deal to me, but for the most part, not going to break any laws, not going to steal, um, not going to do any drugs although I have tried like marijuana in the past, but it’s not something I constantly do, um, just, pretty much I mean, if it’s something I would think I would ashamed to admit I do, then I’m not going to do it, um, I can’t really, I guess that’s it.
I:Okay, alright, um, and what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, when it comes to like substances like that it’s if you’re in, if you still control yourself, like if you could stop if you had to or if, or if like anything that makes you lose control of your behavior I think it wrong, um, I think, I don’t know, that that’s kind of tough question to answer, I guess.
I:Okay, I mean, are there anything that are just wrong in themselves, I mean?
R:Anything that takes advantage of other people too stuff like that, like stealing and you know, like violent things, I don’t know, I can’t really, I’m trying, I can’t really think of a good way to answer that.
I:Okay, does it have to do with the consequences or the I mean, what are the, or does it have to do with some kind of real reason that something is right or wrong otherwise or?
R:Just they way you, I I would feel about myself personally.  Like, um, I I wouldn’t be able to look myself in the mirror after I if I’d like seriously hurt somebody or something.
I:Okay.  How about for other people who don’t feel the same the way that you do, I mean, what if somebody feels like all those things are not really wrong?
R:Well, that’s not a person I’m gonna be around then, personally, but I personally wouldn’t think too highly of them, but.
I:Okay.
R:Just not somebody, not someone I’d be around.
I:Okay, um, alright, from where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Just personal experiences I would think I mean I probably get a little bit of it from my parents but mostly it’s just from what I’ve seen, I guess.","Um, mostly just I think um, I don’t know, just the way I feel about, just inside, like if it, it troubles, like if, if it troubles me to see myself doing something then I’m not going to do it. Um, I guess, after I did the act I as, if I was disappointed in myself for doing it, then I wouldn’t do it, I don’t really, I don’t know how to describe that. It’s generally pretty easy.

R:It is getting easier actually.

R:As I am getting older, it is getting more clear-cut to me what is good and bad.  Whether it is something I should or shouldn’t do.
I:Have your views changed in the past 2 years?
R:No.
I:Can you talk a little more about that?

R:Oddly enough from my parents.  I consider them one of the few people I have seen in life that have tried to do the best they can to do everything right, and also one of the few married couples I have seen that they have been married like 25 years and still really happy.

R:What I, you know, past experiences, like I’ll see it, I’ll you know, they’ll have the classes at school not to do drugs and stuff like that and then I’ve pretty much made my mind up not to do those things, so basically it’s from school, school teaches me a lot of things, to you know to do it or not to do it.
I:What makes something right or wrong?
R:Uh, I don’t know, but um, if I think it’s a good idea then I’ll do it, but if I don’t think it’s a good idea then I won’t.
I:How does that, how do you, thinking of that and based on what you were saying earlier about your friends, that you like people that are good hearted and you know that don’t do bad things to people, how do you work that out, or if you think something’s good you’ll do it.  How do you make the decision if something’s good?
R:I don’t really know, it’s just sometimes, I just know.  I don’t know it’s instinct for me.  If I’ll kind of like see it, that put myself in another person’s position that would have done the thing and you know then I’ll make up my mind and say if it’s not good then I won’t do it, but if it’s okay then I will, you know based on what my instincts say.
I:Can you give me an example of something maybe?
R:Um…kids at my school, they smoke marijuana and they’ll ask me if I want to do it and I’ll think that most people say that yeah it’s a good think to do but I don’t want to do it right now cause I’m not ready for it, and I don’t’ really want to try it cause I don’t really care that much for it, so, I’m not gonna waste my time on it.  So.
I:What about something that might potentially hurt somebody else, or maybe it doesn’t hurt someone, let’s say someone gave you an opportunity to get an A in a class but it would be cheating, how would you know whether to make, whether to do that or whether to not do that?
R:Um…I…
I:And what would you think about to come up with the decision?
R:It would um…um…(pause) well, I would do it if I was suffering in that class and it was really hard for me to do it.
I:Suffering like you knew you would be getting a bad grade?
R:If I was getting a bad grade.  Like in math right now I have an F in that class and I usually have an okay grade, last time I had like a C, but you know, if I’m really suffering and it’s really hard for me to get out of that position, then I will go ahead and take the opportunity as long as everything is okay and nothing was going to happen.
I:Yeah, in that situation, but how do you know, could you follow, do you think you might be able to use that type of reasoning and…not at cheating but say something more serious, not doing drugs, but something that could potentially hurt somebody else, like somebody robs somebody or somebody kills somebody, how do you think, making that decision, moving from and individual oh I am or I am not going to do drugs, or I am or I’m not going to cheat where it’s more about you and it doesn’t affect other people, this way it would more directly affect other people, in terms of making a decision, that whatever you did, whether right or wrong would affect somebody or hurt somebody physically?
R:I wouldn’t because I know, I wouldn’t want to hurt somebody, and I wouldn’t do something to hurt anybody, I mean if it was only going to do something to me but not to anybody else, like to hurt somebody I wouldn’t do it, cause it’s really wrong.
I:Where do you, why do you think that’s wrong?
R:Because um, compared to robbing, like if it was going to hurt somebody physically you know or financially, um, it would be messing up somebody’s life, but as in getting a good grade in the class it’s only going to be affecting me and not the school, because they’re just going to be writing it down in a grade book and um, it could affect me in the long run, but um, if I had an A, you see teachers, they pay more attention to the kids in the higher grades at my school and at most of the schools that I’ve been to, so if I had an A and the teachers had put more responsibility on me I would work really good with that.  So I could probably keep the grade up and not drop down, you know stay down there.  But I have an F in this class because you know I was, when my mom split up I had the emotional problems and stuff like that.  So.","What I, you know, past experiences, like I’ll see it, I’ll you know, they’ll have the classes at school not to do drugs and stuff like that and then I’ve pretty much made my mind up not to do those things, so basically it’s from school, school teaches me a lot of things, to you know to do it or not to do it.

Because um, compared to robbing, like if it was going to hurt somebody physically you know or financially, um, it would be messing up somebody’s life, but as in getting a good grade in the class it’s only going to be affecting me and not the school, because they’re just going to be writing it down in a grade book and um, it could affect me in the long run, but um, if I had an A, you see teachers, they pay more attention to the kids in the higher grades at my school and at most of the schools that I’ve been to, so if I had an A and the teachers had put more responsibility on me I would work really good with that.  So I could probably keep the grade up and not drop down, you know stay down there.  But I have an F in this class because you know I was, when my mom split up I had the emotional problems and stuff like that.

Where do you uh, where do you think like right and wrongs come from?   Or what makes something right and wrong?   Or right or wrong, rather?

I:Okay.
R:And sometimes those laws do not agree with each other.  Um, I don't know if you watch Law and Order, but, um,
I:I haven’t seen it much, I’ve seen it a couple times.

I:Right.

I:Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Where would you say you fall on that?
R:I fall in between.
I:Okay, like how, how do you sort of balance the, or do you have like an example in your head where you had to balance the two?
R:Um, I don’t have an example but I guess if there’s a law in the bible that I don’t agree with and I know that’s wrong, which most of the time there isn’t, I’ll usually go with the other law.  I mean most laws that man’s created are common sense.  You know I’m not gonna go into a store and uh shoplift.

I:How do you kind of decide whether you agree or disagree with the law?
R:If it uh makes sense.
I:Uh-huh.  How it makes sense, is there like a standard by which you judge whether it makes sense or not?
R:Right.  Um, I’m trying to think of something I can give an example with.
I:I know I’m just sort of digging deeper and deeper, but is that,
R:Well like, thy shall not steal, but if there’s something, like if I’m poor and I guess I’m on my death bed and I’m hungry, what else do I have to do, I have to steal.  That would be a time I guess I'd have to go against both laws.

How do you normally know what’s good or bad or right and wrong in life?
R:I know, like, some good – what’s good and what’s bad, so –
I:Like, how do you know that, though?
R:I guess it’s like, you just learn it when you smaller.  And it just develop in your mind, and you just keep focusing at it and just go on from what you have learned.
I:Okay.  And do you think it’s, in general, easy or hard to know what’s right and wrong?
R:Like, for me, I say it easy for me.  But for some people, they probably got, like, a disability or something, so that might make it harder for them.
I:Okay.  But you have no – I mean it’s not difficult for you to know what the right thing to do is in a situation?
R:Yeah, it ain’t difficult for me.
I:Has it gotten easier or harder the last few years?  Like, as you get older, do you think it’s getting harder to figure out what’s right and wrong, or is it easier?
R:It should be, like, easier as you go on.
I:Okay.  Do you have an example of – like, have your views about right and wrong changed in any way over the last few years?  Have you changed your mind about things that you used to think were right, now you think they're wrong?  Or you used to think were wrong, now you think they're right?
R:Not really.
I:Pretty much the same, then?
R:Um hm.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Like, why would something be wrong?
R:Like something that could be wrong is, like – say, like, you steal something.  And then like give it away to somebody or something.  And then, like, the person you stole it from, they’d be looking for it.  Then you tell them a lie, like, “You probably lost it or something.”
I:Okay.  Why is that wrong?  What makes it wrong?
R:Because, like, stealing is wrong because you took – that’s somebody else property.  It belongs to them.  And when you take that from them, that’s stealing.  And it’s wrong.  And that’s uh… it’s like a sin, I think.
I:Yeah.  But why is it wrong?  Like, what is it about it?  Is it because, like, I mean you – because you feel bad about doing it?  Or is it because your actions are bad for that other person?  Or is it because God says it’s wrong?  Is it because there are some rules that you should never steal like that?
R:Right.  Like, when somebody steal something, they probably don't feel bad, like, probably the first time they did it or something.  But, like, as they go down the road, they’re going to feel bad about themselves.
I:Okay.  But is it because they feel bad?  Is that the reason it’s wrong?  Or is it wrong for another reason?
R:Like, for some people, they like doing it.  And they’ll keep doing it.
I:Would you say that’s wrong, even if they like to do it?
R:Yeah.  I mean you’re still wrong.
I:Okay.  Why?  Like, is it – like, is there a rule?  Like, it’s just that’s how reality is?  Stealing is always wrong? Is that – or is it because God says it wrong in the Bible or something?
R:It’s wrong because, like, you know it’s wrong, but you just doing it just to do it.
I:Okay.  Okay.  So there are certain things you think that are absolutely right and wrong?
R:
I:Okay.  But where do you think you’ve acquired your own moral views, like, in terms of your ideas about right or wrong?  Where’d they come from?
R:Like, probably when I was, like, little or something.
I:Like, did your parents teach you this, or your grandparents, or your friends?
R:Yeah.  Parents taught me.","I know, like, some good – what’s good and what’s bad, so – I guess it’s like, you just learn it when you smaller.

How do you normally decide on what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Because of everything I either put myself through or have been through, and what I see through other people and the choices they make.  That’s pretty much how I notice bad and good.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:No.  It’s not easy because I always want to do the bad because bad is normally the easy part, and the good part is normally the hard part.  And I struggle between them because I want to do the easy one because I am still kind of lazy and rebellious, I guess you could say.  And the part of me that wants the best and the better for every – for myself – wants the good part, so I have always struggled with that.  But I always used to take the easy way, and not it’s I am choosing the good way.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Harder because I am trying to do right now instead of letting myself do wrong, even when I knew that there was – should have done right.  But, I mean, it’s better this way.
I:Okay.  Have your views changed about what’s right and wrong the past two years?
R:No.  No.  I don’t think they ever will.
I:Okay.  Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Opinion.
I:Do you?
R:Yeah.
I:Whose opinion?
R:Anyone’s.  And it all depends who is in it – it all depends whether that person believes how much they trust the law.  I mean everyone, I guess, would have a set – a basic set or basic degree of right and wrong that would be generally the same as everyone else’s.  But other than that, that’s pretty much opinion.
I:Okay.  So what does this kind of basic set of right and wrong, where does it come from?  Like what are some of the things that it involves or includes?
R:Unrightful murder, theft, rape – well, I guess, yeah, rape, definitely.  I think that’s all I can think of right now.
I:Okay.  Okay.  So –
R:Anything to harm anyone else or bringing wrong or bad to someone else.
I:So where do those kinds of set of things that are always wrong come from?  I mean why is it that way?
R:People’s choices in life.  That’s pretty much it.
I:Okay.  What makes certain things ultimately right or wrong?
R:The impact that they have on everyone else.
I:Okay.
R:And the impact it has on yourself and the world, generally.
I:Okay.  So where did those ultimate rights and wrongs come from?
R:People.  People’s choices, what they see as, I guess – what they see as what should be done or what shouldn’t be done.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?

What ah, what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:Probably the law, if it says in the law you can’t do it, then you know it’s wrong mostly because you get in trouble for it.  What’s right is probably the opposite you know.  Like if it’s wrong to break out someone’s windows then the right is not to.  So basically the government.
I:So like you say, say if there wasn’t a law against breaking out someone’s windows would you think that it would still be wrong to do it?
R:Yeah, it would still be wrong to do it, but probably a lot more people would do it.
I:I mean, I mean, does what’s wrong depend on what’s defined as what’s law or does it depend on something else do you think?
R:Um, it depends on how your mom and dad raised you too.  If they raised you, you know, they bring you up, tell you what’s right and wrong.
I:Right.
R:You pretty much know what’s right and wrong from their beliefs.
I:Do you think what’s right or wrong for a person to do depends on how they were raised or is it the same for everyone even if people don’t know it’s the same?
R:I think it depends on how they were raised, cause I’ve never really been out of state really, but I hear a lot in Chicago, you know people do stuff and I don’t know if they were raised right or not, but a lot more crimes are down there.
I:Really.  Like if you think someone is raised wrong or raised different, raised a different way do you think that ah, like if they didn’t if they didn’t been raised to do something, but do you think it would still be wrong for them to do it like even if they had been raised differently?
R:Um, depending on what it was, like if it was religious, then it wouldn’t be wrong, but you know if their mom just didn’t really care about them and makes a child feel bad and they don’t really care so they do stupid stuff.
I:Right.
R:And they don’t, and their mom never really taught them right and wrong so they don’t know other than the law.
I:Right.  So you think they wouldn’t necessarily be responsible for it,
R:They’d be responsible for what they did yeah, but I don’t know I guess their moms should have, if they wanted to have a kid they should have raised it differently.","Like most of the time if it involves the cops and stuff, that’s bad.  I don’t want to get in trouble with the cops and stuff.  Cause I’m doing good in school and I don’t want to get caught up in all that.

I:To think that they’re being moral.
R:Yeah, you know.

R:You just do.  I don’t know.
I:No.  Okay.  So, in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s not that hard.
I:Okay.  Has it gotten easier or harder over the past couple years?
R:About the same.
I:About the same. What do think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know.
I:You don’t know.  Is it rules or laws?  Consequences?  How it feels?  God’s will?  Something else?

So, how do you normally know- decide or know what is good or bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I don’t really think about it that much.  Whatever’s good’s good, I don’t really, I’m not really high on morality or any of that stuff.
I:Okay, what do you mean?
R:Unless you do something really horrible, you know, kill someone, it doesn’t really matter right or wrong.  Everything’s, do whatever you want.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to make decisions about things like that?
R:Easy, I don’t really think about it that much.
I:Do you think your views about morality, about right and wrong, have changed over the past couple years?
R:Uh, (pause) no.  I mean, it’s not like I analyze everything “Is this right?  Is this right?...”
I:Okay, so, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  You talked earlier about killing, or things like that.  What do you think it is that makes something wrong or right?
R:You know what, I’m not really too (pause) I don’t know if anything- I really don’t think there’s that much- I don’t put much value on what’s right what’s wrong.  Things have to be egregiously wrong for me to ask- it’s like nothing’s really right or wrong except stuff that’s really really bad.  Like, rape, killing, you know.
I:What about stealing?  Like your roommate came home and said “Dude, I stole ten games from you.  Do you care about that?
R:Oh, like if it wasn’t from me?
I:Well, what if it was for you?
R:No, if it wasn’t from me though.
I:Oh, if it wasn’t from you.
R:Yeah like he didn’t steal 10 of my games he stole them from the store?  Yeah, I wouldn’t care.
I:Would you think it was cool?
R:No, not really.  But would I care?  No.
I:What if he stole a car?
R:(laughs) Same thing, you know.
I:As long as he didn’t steal your car.
R:Right as long as he doesn’t steal my car.  Would I encourage it?  No, but- what people do really doesn’t bother me.  I don’t really care what other people do with their lives as long as it’s not me they’re stealing from.
I:Here’s a situation: let’s say that you were- I mean this is gonna sound a little crazy but I want to see what you’d think- so, let’s say like your roommate was seeing this girl or whatever, and she breaks up with him, and he goes and burns down her house.  What do you think about that?
R:Yeah that’s-
I:She’s not there, she’s away for the weekend.
R:Yeah, but that’s bad enough that it falls into the category of things that are really wrong.
I:So burning down someone’s house.
R:Yeah, you gotta go to  you know?
I:Okay, I just wanted to see where the line was.
R:But I mean like, if, let’s say, took a piss in her gas tank or something like that, that wouldn’t
I:What if like, he threw a brick through her windshield?
R:Depends on how bad it was like, if she banged like 10 other guys behind his back and all that over five years (laughs) then maybe the brick through the windshield would be justified.  If she was just like “Yeah well I want to get- you know I can’t stand this guy anymore” then it wouldn’t.
I:So you’re saying- so, if he was getting back at her for something really bad-
R:Yeah, but…
I:So where do you think you’ve gotten your views of right and wrong from?
R:I don’t know.  Being on this planet for 23 years.
I:Some people think that it’s sometimes okay to break moral rules if it works to your advantage and you can get away with it.  What do you think about that?
R:I mean, I don’t really have moral rules.","I don’t really think about it that much.  Whatever’s good’s good, I don’t really, I’m not really high on morality or any of that stuff.

I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it’s, it’s how it affects both the person, that’s involved with making like, choosing and how it would affect everyone else. Like everyone else with the person.  Like, like, if it’s, if it’s constructive not only to you but also to everyone around you, like if you, if it’s, if it’s something like, okay well do I kill this person or not?  Well, killing them might be good for you because then you feel better but it doesn’t help, it doesn’t help everyone else because then if you get locked up or you get the death sentence and stuff, then all the people that care about you and stuff, it’s not going to be constructive for them.
I:How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?   Are there a set of rules or is it just more of this kind of instinct and basic understandings or?
R:Uh, I, I just say that like the set in stone stuff I would say would come from the bible and, and uh, my foundation for faith.  And then sometimes like, sometimes people complain about how, like the bible doesn’t talk about listening to music and things like that, sometimes then, like I’ll try to find things that relate to the same thing, or that I’ll like go in, like, like I’ll analyze it and figure out which way it weighs and kind of think about what my conscience is saying so.
I:So do you actually sort of, uh reference the bible in terms of questions like that come up?
R:Yeah.
I:Whether it’s music or, are there other things besides music say, that, that might come up with?
R:Um, um, sometimes, let’s see.  I don’t know sometimes people like, like sometimes like I’ll hear people that will be like, well smoking and stuff isn’t talked about in the bible and things like that, so what do you do about that, and things like that.  Some of the things that like in the times the bible didn’t nec – didn’t really exist and stuff.","Um, I, I think it comes from like, a Christian foundation and also sometimes just instinct.

R:Uh, well first thing I’d probably just look to what I know of the Bible, whether the Bible specifically talks about it or not.  Then, uh, probably, what I would like, think about what my parents would say about it.  And then, uh, I’d just try and weigh the pros and cons, uh, just kind of look at it, is this beneficial or detrimental, or is it beneficial to be but maybe detrimental to others.
I:And, do you think that in general it is easy or hard to decide between what is right and wrong?
R:Uh, for the most part I’d say it’s fairly easy for some of the more difficult questions.  Mostly stuff dealing with relationships, I mean where there really isn’t a right or wrong answer.  I mean, it’s just a lot harder just because, I mean, even if you ask people you will get a lot of different responses.
I:And, would you say that trying to make those kinds of rights and wrong decisions or decisions about right and wrong have gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years?
R:I would think easier just since I have had more time having to make decisions.  I have got a lot more precedence, not really that I record every time I have made a decision.  I have kind of set these railroad tracks to follow.  If something comes up that I have kind of experienced before, like if I didn’t do before I’ve got a better chance of not doing it because I haven’t done it before.
I:What is it that makes something right or wrong?
R:Uh, I’d say the biggest thing is how it affects someone personally.  How, what is really does to, to like, not really like your personality but like your character.  Uh, like, I mean if it’s like a question of do I steal this, just, is it something like are you basically going to become a person that is going to steal?  Is it going to be multiple times?  Is it later going to cause you trouble?  Is it, uh, is it going to give you a jaded view of everything?  Is it going to shift your perspective in many ways?  Just like this greater picture of, outside of this one event what are the implications and I would just say that, and that just compared with, comparing it to the normal ideas or right and wrong, as seen in the Bible.
I:Tell me about that.  Right and wrong as seen in the Bible.
R:Just, uh, if it hurts others, uh, more in a selfish way than in a just way.  Just because it’s impossible not to hurt some people.  Uh, if it’s, if it is in violation of, just good morals things like that.  Things like if it’s stealing or, or extensive lying or things that hurt your body like drugs…
I:So you would say, let me read this back to you and you say whether you agree or disagree with it.  The first time you said you’d be concerned with how it would affect the individual.  So, in terms of their character,
R:Right.
I:If they steal something they might continue on in that path.  It might erode at their character in some way.  There was another layer that says that there are certain things that are…
R:Right.
I:Right and wrong because that’s in the Bible?
R:Right.
I:Ok.  Um, and, so those would be just off the top of your head?  The general kinds of things like stealing, uh, you mentioned stealing,
R:Yeah, stealing,
I:What other kinds of things?  I mean, I don’t need an exhaustive list but,
R:I mean, a lot of things that are like criminal offenses, stealing, murder, uh, uh, like lying, ah, just the things that will hurt your body like drugs and drinking.  And just, yeah, a lot of thing in that field that that really in essence cause negative effects.
I:And, and, you’re sort of belief that these are wrong would be because of their effects of because they are prohibited in the Bible?
R:Uh, I would say both in the idea that they are prohibited in the Bible because of their effects.  And, ah, and in the case of things that aren’t mentioned in the Bible that is when you just look at the effects of them and say well how do these compare.
I:Um, where do your moral views come from?  Where have you picked those up?
R:Uh, I would say a lot of them are founded from the Bible just growing up in a Christian home and from various Christian schools.  That was definitely like the cornerstone of everything.  And then, uh, like learning to reason like growing up and being more knowledgeable.  Just, uh, building on that and uh, basically comparing everything to that.  Like, if it wasn’t specifically in the Bible, comparing it to something that might relate or trying to see how it relates and then just, uh, using my reasoning in that to figure it out.

R:Probably three main things I do is probably just – the first thing I’d probably do just naturally is think about it reflectively.  Just like, what do I think, what do I feel about this?  Is it a logical choice kind of thing?  But I’d probably consult – alongside that I’d probably then just consult the spiritual beliefs.  Is this religiously – does this have impact?  Is this against what I believe?  And the third one is probably just consult friends, and peers, and adults.  Since I do have close relationship with my parents I usually ask them a lot of questions, and I just like to just hear a lot of points of view.  Unfortunately, I did this when I was deciding to go or not go to grad school, and unfortunately about every other person had a different opinion.  So at the end of it, half of the people I consulted said to go, and half of them said not to.
I:So it wasn’t that helpful.
R:Yeah.
I:Is it usually very hard for you, or is it easy for you to figure out what’s right and wrong, to decide?
R:It’s usually pretty easy to decide.  It becomes harder than when I necessarily have to make a choice about which I want to do because sometimes – an easy example is I have – the meal plan at school offers me ten meals in the cafeteria, whereas I could easily just hop in my car and go to Burger King, and when I only have $40 in a bank account, the right choice is probably just to get the free meal that’s in the cafe, but I might not necessarily actually do that, so.  Other than – yeah, I’d say figuring it out is usually pretty easy.  I’d say the time decisions are hard is when there’s not necessarily a right answer.  Where it’s like, do I go to grad school, or do I just pursue a job.  Or neither of those is inherently wrong, so.
I:And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last couple years since we last talked?
R:It’s probably gotten easier just as – I probably cemented more of my beliefs, and just who I am.  So it’s probably a lot easier and more natural for me to kind of have a precedent of decisions that I’ve made in the past.
I:Have your views changed in the last couple of years?  About right and wrong issues?
R:If anything I’d say I’ve become more considerate and compassionate for other people, and not necessarily as judgmental as I have been about the decisions they make, so.
I:What do you think that comes from?
R:Some of it maybe just because the friendships I’ve had have grown.  I’ve had them for longer, and I know the people more, and I’m more, I don’t know, maybe in touch with their lives personally that I try to be more supportive in everything they do.  And part of it too might just be, like, my major’s a lot of working with people with disabilities either communication, or cognitive level disabilities, and even in that you learn a lot about multicultural issues, and different views, and I think part of that may have instilled kind of a sense of acceptance for all different people regardless of what they’re doing and who they are, so.
I:What is it you think there is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think the easiest – or maybe it’s not the easiest, but a good way to examine it I think is to compare it against just what the Bible says religiously.  Unfortunately with the evolution of society, the Bible doesn’t necessarily talk about everything that we deal with today.  And so I think in those instances it’s best to – even if it’s – if you can’t find anything explicitly corollary is to consult the scriptures, and then just kind of think about it logically, and retrospectively what is – what are the positive and negative affects of this particular action or decision, and then just kind of – and if that doesn’t even seem explanatory, just like at that point then saying, “Well, what other people do I know, or other people that have similar values of me, what kind of decisions have they made in the past in looking at are there precedence for other people that have gone through this.”
I:So in general, you would frame your decision making process in understanding what’s right and wrong that there's a standard out there, and you reference then the Bible, and then if that’s not clear because it’s not – it doesn’t give every possible connotation, then you might look to other people.  Do you ever – would you have conversation with the people about that?
R:Yeah, I would definitely talk to peers about it, especially for those more kind of gray areas.  I definitely would consult peers or adults that have more experience in life, and just be like, what is – “You might be able to see this in a greater spectrum than I can, so.”
I:And where do your moral beliefs come from?  Where’d you get your moral beliefs?
R:I’d say probably from four places.  Probably from – definitely from my parents and what – and how they raised me.  From just the Bible itself, and just what it said.  And then from – part of it would also be from just my own experiences in life, and what I’ve come to learn, and just what’s been revealed through personal experience.  And then the last one would probably just be just kind of those who kind of like in instance like education, but not necessarily schoolbook so much as just educators and mentors.  Either just adults that have come alongside me in life, or even teachers.","Probably three main things I do is probably just – the first thing I’d probably do just naturally is think about it reflectively.

I:Okay.  So, that, okay, so most of the things you come up are, you know whether your parents want to do, whether your parents give you permission or not, that’s kind of the?
R:Well mostly my parents do give me permission but sometimes I’m not allowed because I have to go somewhere or I’m grounded and so like the one time I was just talking about, I was um, my Mom just wanted me to come home, I don’t know why, just stupid reasons so I decided just to go, I only got grounded for like a day so it wasn’t that big of a deal.
I:So you think it was worth it.
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.
R:And then I wasn’t supposed to go to the next day, too, but I still went cause my Dad didn’t know that I, cause he drove me, he didn’t know that I wasn’t allowed to go cause my Mom didn’t talk—
I:He didn’t know you were grounded?
R:Cause my Mom was away and she didn’t want me going.  And so, he didn’t know I was grounded.
I:What, what, what, what was the thing that your Mom didn’t want you to go to?
R:Um, a basketball tournament, not for me for, or, yeah, my friends were all going and so I wanted to go.
I:Yeah, just to watch.
R:Yeah and to have fun, we usually, and we went over to the mall, just hung out, went to the library and stuff like that.","Um, a little bit from my parents I guess and just from things in society I guess.  And— Um, I don’t know and just from miscellaneous parents and stuff and people and I don’t know, just certain things and people. Um, ah, if I should um go somewhere after school with my friends even though my parents told me I couldn’t and so I decided that just going and then getting, being grounded for a couple days would be the better choice for me cause it was like a big event, event and I had fun.

R:um, right is right and what’s wrong is wrong, you know your mistakes in life, so…
I:how do you know what’s right and wrong, what’s good and bad?
R:‘cause you should know what you look at and how you choose it, what you do with your life, whatever you see and you know it’s wrong, then you know it’s wrong.
I:in general is it easy or hard for you to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:sometimes it’s easy, most of the time it is easy ‘cause you know what’s wrong and what’s right.
I:tell me an example of when it’s hard?
R:probably one of them days when you don’t feel like going to basketball practice, you just wanna go home and go to bed, but you gotta look into your life and see if this is really one of the things you want to do, you better go. That’s probably one of the hardest ones I had, or an essay you had to do, that one day and you only had two days to do it and you waited till the last day to do it, knowing you should have done it before.
I:would you say that choosing between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder over the last two years?
R:in between easy and hard ‘cause you have classes, well when I was in high school where if you didn’t do it that day, you might as well say forget it you’re not graduating, so it had to be hard for me to say, I’m gonna do it right now.
I:can you tell me about an, okay, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:what do you mean?
I:basically, how do you determine if something is right and wrong? What do you think it is about something that makes it right or wrong. Let me give you some examples. Is it rules or laws that makes something right or wrong, or is it consequences or is it how it feels or is it god’s will or is it something else? As you measure something’s right or wrong, what would you say helps you determine?
R:the future is what helps me determine. Probably look and seeing what’s the next step that you want to take in life?

I:so to some extent it’s consequences?
R:yeah.
I:so consequences kind of determine what you view as right and wrong?
R:yeah.
I:who taught you what’s right and wrong, where did you learn that from?
R:My mother and when I was younger and as I got older it was *K*, you know the choices that you make in life, whatever you do in life it’s on you, so you take that into your own box, you don’t go stay in a circle, you go in the outside of the box.
I:did you say, you said you go to god’s side of the box?
R:no I said . So.
I:and have you acquired your view of right and wrong from anywhere else?

R:I go with my intuition.  Whatever I’m feeling, if it feels right, go for it.  If it doesn’t…
I:And you find that pretty reliable?
R:I do, I do.
I:So how easy or hard is it for you to decide, “this is right,” or “this is wrong?”
R:It’s very easy, very easy.  I mean, and I’m not saying that when I know something is wrong, I may still do it.  And I kind of love that I’m at the point that I can be able to know that, say that, and still do the wrong thing and be able to do the wrong thing and still stand behind it and be like, “I messed up, I knew I messed up.”  I’m not saying that I’m perfect.
I:Where do you think your intuition comes from?
R:My experiences.
I:Like, for example…
R:Like, when I moved to Rich Square* my stepfather was a hard worker, so he expected me to be a hard worker.  He expected me to get up in the morning, do my chores, do what I had to do around the house.  And that had a lot to do with what I think is right and wrong with that.  Now I can’t lay in the bed.  I feel like a man period.  This is something I feel.  A man should get up, in the morning, and do something.  So most of the time my experiences, the things I’ve been through, you know, I just try not to make the same mistakes twice.  If I feel like it’s right, then I go with it.
I:Now, how, by the way, did you get along with your stepfather in general?
R:We get along.  I was young and I was lonely for a male role model, so, I don’t think he was the person for the job, but…
I:Because, why not?
R:I don’t think he was a good person.  I don’t think, I mean, he had his values, his work ethic.  That’s what I took from that experience.  Him as a person, he just, you know, he was mean, you know, and I didn’t think he was a good person at all.
I:And did he and your mom eventually divorce?
R:He died.
I:He died, oh my.
R:That’s what brought us back to Greensboro.
I:Okay, has it gotten harder or easier in the past 3 years to decide between right and wrong?  Or is it the same?
R:It’s definitely gotten easier.
I:Why is that?
R:I guess because I kind of, I guess, growth and maturing, kind of now realize, now I realize I am who I am.  And there’s nothing I can do about that or anyone else, so I walk with my head up, and I could care less what you think, what the next person thinks, I could care less.  So that makes it easy to make decisions.
I:So you just do what you think is right and you don’t care what others…And when you’re younger it’s different than that?
R:When you’re younger you do what you think is acceptable to who you think is important.  And right now I’m not saying I’m a rebel without a cause, I’m a do me whatever, whatever.  It’s just that I feel like it’s important for a man, if he’s going to say something, if he’s going to do something, be man enough to stand behind that, rather than, if it’s wrong and you find out it’s wrong, be man enough to apologize and accept that you messed up.  But you have to, I think that’s the problem that with my generation, we don’t stand behind, we’re not responsible.  We don’t stand behind our responsibility, that’s why you have a bunch of single women, raising sons, because these men are not standing behind their responsibility with that.  And I feel like that’s the issue.  So, right or wrong I try to stand behind what I do.  That’s not to be overly confident, that’s just trying to be responsible.
I:And how did you think you come to that, that’s a pretty mature understanding.  What brought that to you or how did you learn that?
R:Once again, my experiences.  Coming up, I just always though a man was weak if they would do something and wouldn’t own up to it, you know what I’m saying.
I:Did you have specific negative role models.  Like people you saw doing that?
R:I did.  Like my father.  He wasn’t around.  He had responsibilities.  I always thought he was weak for that.  And my stepfather, he would do things, you know, and he would act like it was right when I felt like it was obvious that it was wrong.  And just that showed me what I need to do.
I:So we’ve been talking about moral right and wrong.  What is it that actually makes things right and wrong?  What ultimately is the source of morals?
R:Speaking for myself?
I:What do you think?
R:It’s for me, for me, it’s what God, what the bible says.  What I feel like “Would this make God happy?”  That’s how I judge my life.","I go with my intuition.

What I feel like “Would this make God happy?”  That’s how I judge my life.","The respondent makes decisions primarily based on intuition shaped by personal experiences, particularly influenced by a strong work ethic instilled by their stepfather, while also emphasizing the importance of moral responsibility to help others, guided by their belief in God and the Bible, despite expressing a reluctance to identify strictly as a Christian due to concerns about the authenticity of some who label themselves as such."

R:You know like it’s just a feeling that you get, if you know it’s wrong. You know it might be some bad consequences.  You get that feeling, you know you’re about to do something wrong.  That’s how I know.
I:And in general is easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Sometimes it’s hard, it’s the temptation, like sometimes, I like want something and I might have to do the wrong thing to get it and it just might be a battle between should I do it or shouldn’t I do it.  Sometimes it’s hard.
I:and has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years?
R:I think it got easier because I don’t want to go to jail or nothing like that, so like when I was younger, I need to just think because I’m gonna do a certain thing.  I’m just gonna go ahead and do it because I wanted something.  Now that I’m older though I know that there are a lot of bad consequences to some of the decisions we make.  So I make ‘em wisely.
I:And so, you mention that consequences are basically what makes something right or wrong? What kinds of consequences makes something wrong?
R:If you could go to jail for what you want, then what you’re doing in wrong.
I:ok, and are there any other situations where maybe you wouldn’t go to jail for it, but you feel like it’s still wrong?
R:Not really, well, if you’re doing something wrong, most likely you won’t go to jail for it.  Just something major.
I:Ok, and from where have you acquired your moral views?

How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I look at the pros and cons.  Like, okay, this is gonna put me in this situation, this will put me in a better situation.  I just do the pros and cons and what the consequences are with them.
I:Okay, so do you think you’re pretty good about taking time and thinking things through like that, or do things happen pretty quickly and—
R:I take time, sometimes if I know that it’s not gonna hurt me, I’ll take the risk, like with the boyfriend status thingy, I kind of took a risk with Eric* and it’s been going good so far.  I just kind of said, okay, well I’ve known you for a while, I know the pros and cons and what you have and haven’t done, so.  That was, that was one of the jump thingys that I took, but that’s the only one, so far.
I:Okay, how hard or easy do you find it, to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s more easier to decide the right, because of the way I was raised.  I was, instead of getting yelled at and spanked, my Mom always sat, my Mom and my Dad always sat me down and explained to me why this was wrong, why this was right.  So, that’s.
I:So you think you have the tools to work things out?
R:Because they always told me and explained why this is bad and this is good.
I:Do you think deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder over the past couple years?
R:Lately it’s gotten easier, but like six or seven months ago, it was really hard for me.
I:What was the difference?
R:Um, I was with a different person and he was always like controlling me and I couldn’t make my own decisions and I had to struggle with them and now it’s more like, okay, Eric* lets me think my own way and I let him think his own way.  And he tells me if it’s right or wrong or not, so.
I:Yeah.  What do you think it was that kept you in that relationship?
R:Um, his little sister kept me in that relationship.
I:How so?
R:Because every time that I leave, she wouldn’t eat for two or three or four days, nobody could get anything down her.
I:How old is she?
R:She’s five.  And nobody could get anything down her and then when I came back, she’d just eat and eat and eat, so that’s what kept me there for two and a half there, in that relationship, was his little sister, so.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, if it’s going to hurt somebody or help somebody, I think, is right and wrong.
I:Okay.  Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Yes, there’s always something wrong with, I think, always something, there’s always gonna be something you, small or big, always gonna be something a little wrong with the decision that you make.  Like it hurt somebody else but helped another person.  Or lately that’s how it’s been with me.  Because of leaving Curtis* it hurt his little sister.  Getting together with Eric* hurt Curtis* and made things better for me, so.
I:So, how do you decide then, when you have things that have a little bit of wrong in them?
R:I look at the pros and cons more, I thought, okay, well my life with Eric* is gonna be better because he’s not gonna call me, he’s not abusive, no matter what, he’s the type of person that opens doors and doesn’t let you spend any money but his, but lately we’ve been using both of ours to fix his car, but that’s what, that’s how, what made my decision to get together with him.
I:Okay.  From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Um, looking at, looking at my older siblings and what they’ve done right and wrong in life.  Because I’m the baby of the family and watching them go through their struggles and their problems, made me like choose a different path than theirs.
I:Can you give me some examples of specific problems you’d seen them in, and you’ve stayed away from it?
R:My brother um, became an alcoholic and my sister hasn’t worked in 25 years and has really done nothing.  So I stayed away from those two things.  And those were the two biggest issues.  Especially the alcoholic one.  I’ve never, I drink sometimes, like maybe I don’t know, once every three months or something, with good friends or a birthday party or something, but that’s about it.  Nothing else.  I don’t do any drugs or.  My brother got into drugs and my sister started popping pills and I haven’t done, I’ve stayed away from that.
I:What do you think is wrong about that, makes it wrong in your mind?
R:It could hurt, it makes you wrong in your mind, and it also can hurt your body, physically and mentally.  Because I know it hurt my brother really mentally, until recently, until he got off of it.  And my sister, I think it hasn’t, her not working and spending everybody else’s money but hers has made her, like if I don’t get this money I can’t, I can’t live.  Why can’t you go out and make your own money and use your own?  That’s the way I figure it.","I look at the pros and cons.

I think there are three things that are never okay in any circumstance.  Things like murder, murder or rape; heavy stealing, not like I'm stealing this bread because I'm starving, but someone kidnapping or something like that-that’s never okay.  But I guess I can understand, like I would say murder is the same all the time.

I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Again, to go back to the whole idea, if I wanted to do whatever the action is, what I would do is think if that would cause anybody else an injustice for whatever reason.  That’s how I would decide, I guess.

I:Do you think that God is the source of morality?
R:I think, yeah I do, but I think that there isn’t just like god is symbolic of pretty much… I think that every people in every culture and religion has, even polytheistic people, have that Father god figure, like that Father figure and I guess it doesn’t have to be male, but just that one head honcho guy and that is god.  So there’s one god for Christians and one god for Jewish people, even Hindi and even Buddhists they have that Buddha and that’s the big figure.  I think that even the Christian god is just a coalition of all those gods, like all those figures come together, so yeah I agree that morality comes from god.","A lot of times I use the whole idea of the whole golden rule, I think do unto others what you do unto yourself and what you would want done to you.

I know that and like, it just, Yeah, yeah, just driving while you’re drunk, and like things that will, things that will like end result will probably be hurt or end up in trouble and those are bad decisions.","The respondent believes that while they have a clear understanding of right and wrong, they feel that many people today know the difference but do not care about the consequences of their actions, attributing their own moral views largely to their parents, and expressing guilt over past wrongdoings like cheating and shoplifting, while also acknowledging the influence of peer pressure in their decisions to engage in drinking and drug use.","I:How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I go by religion a little bit.  Religion, and sometimes I’ll just go by, like I look at the consequences.  The consequences are, look like they’re going to hurt someone, then I’m not going to do it.
I:Tell me what you mean by like you go by religion?
R:Like religion will say like uh, you know like, you can’t use certain words in vain or something like that.  I can’t use God’s name in vain, or you can’t lie against your brother, so I go by religion.
I:And in terms of consequences, what do you mean by that?
R:Like if I know something is going to make my mom mad, I won’t do it.  Or if it’s going to make one of my friends hurt, I won’t do it.  So I look at the consequences first.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy, but sometimes it can be like real hard.
I:How can it be hard?
R:Like, cause like, sometimes I don’t really trust like what religion says.  Cause like, I feel like, like, I don’t know it seems like a lot, like it’s supposed to be like a sin to go to Las Vegas, but then like gambling, so I feel odd about certain things like that.  I feel like some things are twisted a little bit.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:I think harder.
I:Harder?
R:Yeah, cause like religion, now that I know what’s wrong in religion, I’m kind of using religion a lot more, so the things that like I used to do before I don’t do now because of religion.  So it’s like, I feel like things are changing.
I:So it’s harder because you, cause your religious involvement is telling you that certain things are wrong even though there’s things that you used to do, and now it’s telling you that some of those things are wrong and you might want to choose to do those anyway even though religion
R:Yeah cause I did it before and it didn’t, there was no problem.
I:Yeah.
R:But now it’s like bad for religion, so I’m like, oh, okay.  I’m not sure if it is right or wrong, so I just try to go on.
I:So you try to not do the things that your religion says are wrong?
R:Yeah, try to go with religion.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  You’ve talked about consequences, you’ve talked about religion, what is it about the certain things that make them right or wrong?
R:Um, well, like when we hurt someone, or if they’re bad for you, I know that like, I think the thing that’s always coming up is like drugs.  And I look at that, it can hurt me, it can hurt me a lot.  I can die from it, so, I look at it like that.  Like what it can do to me, and what it can do to other, like it will make my mom real, real mad.  It can change our relationship by a lot.  So I avoid that.
I:Do you think it’s mostly the consequences that makes something bad or is it something else?
R:Um, I know it’s against the law, but lately I haven’t really been worried about the law.
I:Yeah.
R:So I’d rather worry like about my mom than the law.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?  Some things that no matter what are always wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Like what?
R:Like stealing.  I think stealing is like real bad.  Stealing or cheating or, doing drugs.
I:What is it that makes these things wrong?  Stealing and cheating and then those sound a little bit different than taking drugs, but tell me why those things in and of themselves would be wrong?
R:Well to me stealing is like real, it hurts, it hurts when it happens to you and it makes another person feel good, and I think if it makes you feel good and it takes away some control from someone else, it’s like, it’s wrong.  And I don’t know I go by religion on that too you know.  Cause like, it says like you can’t steal from other people you know.
I:Where do you think you’ve gotten your moral views from?
R:Um, I think from my mom and from this religion.","I go by religion a little bit.  Religion, and sometimes I’ll just go by, like I look at the consequences.

R:Yeah.
I:Anything else?

I:Mostly your parents?
R:Yeah.

So, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:I think it over.  Just decide.  Like my parents always say I’m more mature for my age, because I always think of what’s going on before I do it.

R:It’s pretty easy.
I:Okay.  And has it gotten harder or easier over the last couple years?
R:It’s gone easier.
I:Easier?  Why is that?
R:Because I know what’s going on, I understand the stuff.
I:Okay.
R:And I’ve usually seen it happen to one of my friends or my family so it’s like I basically know what to do.
I:So, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Well, I’m not sure.  I’m just, I kind of understand it, like, like if I want to go out and I don’t tell my parents, then I have to think it over.  Like, my parents are usually understanding about that stuff, so I can usually come to them and ask them and they usually say yes, so stuff like that.
I:Okay, so if somebody said, hey let’s go do this, and you said, no I don’t want to do that because I think it would be wrong, what would it be that was making it wrong?  Would it be, like because it’s against rules, or is it about whether or not you’d get caught, or how your parents might feel, or?

R:Well, it’s about all those.  It’s like the rules and stuff.  I usually follow them.
I:Is there any one of those that takes priority for you?
R:Well, it’s just knowing if it’s bad or wrong and stuff like, because of school and stuff, like they’ve given us examples about what happens if, when like you don’t do it and you do do it, so yeah.
I:Okay.  So, are there any actions that you think are always wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Like what?
R:Like drugs.
I:Drugs are always wrong.
R:Yeah.

R:Yeah.
I:Okay, is there any other, is that what makes them wrong, in the fact that they have the potential to hurt you?

I:Personal experience?
R:Yeah, for the most part.

R:Uh, what do you mean?
I:Where do you, how do you know what’s right and wrong?  And where do those, what tells you that what’s right and what’s wrong.
R:Oh, I grew up with a lady that always told me what’s right and what’s wrong.  It was my Aunt Luenda,
I:Uh-huh.
R:She always told me that you can always see someone’s right and wrong. If you see someone getting messed up or someone’s abusing someone, you know it’s wrong.  And sometimes it’s, it’s just obvious.  It’s just, in your heart you know it’s right or wrong.  And when you see something you know it’s right or wrong.
I:And how do you know what’s right or wrong for you?  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Something that’s just odd.  Like if a kid is getting abused and you know he’s going to school hit, even though he didn’t do something wrong, it’s kind of wrong.  Because punishment shouldn’t always be through pain. That’s what I think.  I think that’s wrong.
I:And so, so it’s about…
R:It’s about other people getting afflicted by something.  It’s that, oh I say that no one should be punished really.  I don’t like,
I:So you think it has to do with hurting other people or something like that?
R:Yeah, if it’s hurting someone else it’s wrong.  If it’s hurting anyone else it’s wrong.
I:And why is that?
R:Because people don’t really, most people don’t deserve to get hurt.  I don’t see people getting hurt is right no matter what.
I:What makes, what is it that makes hurting someone else wrong do you think?
R:The fact that, I can’t really explain that but I would know if someone really hurt me, it would really hurt me emotionally, and I think that’s wrong because I know how that feels and I wouldn’t want anyone else in the world to feel that way.
I:Okay.  Um, can you give me some examples maybe from your life that you’ve seen maybe something that you thought was really wrong?  Or maybe experienced?
R:I’ve seen lots of uh, fights at school that I think is wrong.  Kids get picked on, and you know they get stuff stolen.  I think a lot of stuff that goes on at school is wrong.
I:What school do you go to?
R:Uh, Glen Curtis.
I:It’s a middle school?

Oh there goes the trash.
R:Oh, I’ll get it after.  I’d say a little bit of gut feelings.  Sometimes – it’s hard to explain, but you know – without anyone telling you, you know what feels right or wrong.  Even if you have to lie sometimes, you know it would bring about a better conclusion.
I:And how do you – in general, how hard or easy is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I’d say it’s very easy.  I’m quick to do what’s right.  And I usually – if I know I’m doing something wrong, I hesitate more than once.
I:And has that gotten easier or harder over the last few years?
R:It’s gotten really easy.  I feel like the more nicer things I do, the more things I do that are right, that the outcome is a lot better.  I never have anything – nothing ever comes bad out of doing something right.
I:And is that why it’s gotten easier?  Because over the past, the result –
R:Yeah.  Because I know that will happen, so I have no problem doing the right thing.
I:Has your views about right and wrong changed over the last couple years?
R:I feel a little bit more like those who do wrong almost get closer to their goals than those who do right.  But I’m still for doing right.
I:What do you think it is that actually makes something right or wrong?  Kind of like, how do you get that gut feeling?  What’s that all about?
R:I think it’s – well, the gut feeling comes from the fear of something bad happening.
I:To you or to someone else?
R:Or to someone else, yeah.  Because it’s been the times where it’s been, like, do I do this?  And I try to imagine, can it hurt me?  It’s okay if it hurts me as long as if things don’t get out of control or if, I think, no one gets hurt.  It’s that type of – it is a gut feeling, but it’s mostly based on a good outcome.  If the outcome is very good, you know, I’ve gotta kinda weigh it.  If I don’t do it, things can get bad.  But if I do it, things can get good.  And if it weighs out pretty well, then I’ll do it.
I:Are there specific kinds of things?  Or is it just, you know, physical or emotional hurt?  Or what is it in terms of what happens to you or somebody else that would be bad?  What do you mean by that?  Just, you know, maybe an example or two.
R:Well, I know, like – well, a recent example, I’ve had a friend, she was very distressed.  And people feel like when someone’s in distress, just leave them alone.  And I feel like she was going into her own little cave and, you know, just crying.  And I kind of confronted her, and people didn’t want me to confront her.  They are like, “You are just gonna make things worse.”  But I felt like it was a gut feeling that to confront her and find out what was wrong with her was right.  And I confronted her, and she let it out.  And she – it was almost immediately as she let it out, she got better.  And things like that.  It’s almost like you feel like you should do it, then I just – if I feel like I should do it and it’s right, then I gotta do it.
I:Where do you think you’ve gotten your moral views from?
R:We always – we talk about that as a family topic.
I:Really?
R:And we – no one knows.
I:Really?
R:Yeah.  Because my mom is very – she is very aggressive.  And my stepdad is a little bit sneaky sometimes.  So it’s like, who did he get it from?  And it’s like I guess I learned from watching the right things to do the wrong – I mean I learned from watching the wrong things to do the right things.
I:Okay.  So it’s sort of a – I don't know what to call it – maybe a negative example.
R:Yeah.
I:That’s interesting.  So in terms of values that you have, you know, what you know is right and wrong, you watch what your mom and stepdad do.
R:Uh-huh.
I:How does that – what do you think about – is that the same or different in terms of how you actually view things?  Or –
R:Yeah.  Because I know my mom is a fight first type of person.
I:Yeah.
R:She’d rather not talk it out.  If she has the chance to, she will hit somebody.  And she – I have seen her, you know.  So I know, like – it’s almost like the negative examples, completely.
I:Yeah.  Yeah.
R:And same thing with my stepdad.  He won’t – I don’t think he likes to think twice.  He’ll just, “Yeah, that looks right.”  And he’ll do it.  And I’ll think for – it’s almost like I’ll think, how come he didn’t do that?  And he’ll be like, “Oh, how come you didn’t tell me?”
I:Yeah.
R:And it’s like, oh, I thought you thought that already.  So it’s almost like I learned from them bad –

I:And why do you think it would be bad to hurt people’s feelings?

How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Um.  I have a very good sense of what’s right and wrong from my parents teaching me.  I’m pretty lax about it actually now, because they were so strict with me.  I kind of was just like “Oh, okay, well, I’m just gonna chill.”  Or whatever.

R:I mean, like, they were seriously into it.
I:That must have been tough.
R:Yeah, I mean, everyday.  Yeah.
I:So, do you still though, so that’s influence.  Do you still think things through?
R:Yes.  I do.  I think things through.  I mean, sometimes I know that my parents would think that it would be wrong, but my opinions are different.
I:Where do you get your opinions?
R:Um, just as a collaboration of everything that I’ve learned over the years with how strict my parents were and how I can see that other people were too lax with their kids.  And how I can see that my siblings, since I’m the youngest, I guess watch all six of them before me screw up all their lives and try and fix them.  And then fix them.  And then something went wrong again.  I guess I can see all their problems pan out in front of me and how they dealt with them.
I:Yeah, that’s helpful.
R:…and so, it’s a lot easier, actually, to watch everyone else make their mistakes so I can say well I’m not going to make the mistakes Kim* did, I’m not going to do the one’s Brad* did…   Cathy* was okay, she did alright…  I could kind of follow her path.
I:Yeah, that makes sense.  In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy.
I:It’s easy?
R:I don’t really have a problem with it.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:It’s stayed pretty much the same, actually.  I don’t find it much different.
I:Okay. What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um.  Your conscience.
I:Your conscience?
R:Ah, it’s…it is set wrong and right, but…you have to decide for yourself.
I:So, what kind-
R:--It’s just the laws of the world that make it right or wrong.  Like there are things that are morally correct and morally incorrect.  Like, you shouldn’t kill babies before they’re born, I mean that’s like morally…
I:So there are moral absolutes?
R:Yeah.
I:Where do they come from thought, because some people would see things differently.
R:People, unlike animals, have consciences.  We have souls, we have understanding.  Animals just kind of go about.
I:So, there’s like an innate…
R:Yeah.  We can realize the absolutes that are right and wrong.  Animals just can’t.  It’s not that we’re deciding them, it’s that we realize them.
I:Okay.  Right.  So there are moral absolutes that people have the capacity to realize.
R:Yeah.  It’s not that, it’s that people can understand them.  I don’t know.  People can understand them, animals can’t.  We’re a higher being than animals are, so we can realize that there are absolutes that you can’t break.
I:So, when people do violate those sorts of things, do you think they know that they’re doing something wrong?
R:I think so.
I:Yeah.
R:I think so, your conscience doesn’t lie to you.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Um, collaboration of my parents, the world, experiences all that together.
I:Okay, have your views about right and wrong changed over the past few years? … we’ve asked you this already.  Okay…and you said no.    Um, some people think that the world is always changing and we should adjust our views of what is morally right and wrong to reflect those changes.  What do you think of that view?
R:Um, I think it’s true to an extent.  The world changes…but like I said, the absolutes never will change.  But I think you have to change with your generation.

If it’s something that, doing something for your community, or something like that.  But I mean if like you start selling drugs or something like that you should know the sense that it’s wrong and if you just, just go with it then you should be okay.

I:Mm-mm, right.
R:Like for a good thing is just getting into sports, cause sports can get you somewhere in life, so.
I:Right.

R:I would say that’s no way to get by, if you want to get by, get a job and support your own habit.  Like don’t, when you get a job you’re, you’re making your own money, you’re working for it, once you’re selling drugs and stuff you’re pretty much messing up in life cause someone gives it to you and if you don’t sell it you should, could get shot or something like that, so it’s kind of not worth doing it.

How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?

R:Uh, when it’s a yes, like, I don’t know I just don’t feel that it’s wrong.  But if it feels that it’s wrong I just don’t do it.  It’s hard to explain.

I:What do you
R:Cause now I know the consequence if I do something wrong and I don’t want to do anything wrong, so I think about it a lot more, and I already figure out a way to do it right instead of wrong.

R:That makes something right or wrong?
I:Uh-huh.
R:Well, if you do something wrong, then, um,  there’s a lot of different things that can happen to you, like you can go to jail or something like that.  And if it’s right then, uh, just right and you cant get in trouble for it.
I:What if there was something someone could do and they knew that they could never get caught, would that make it okay?
R:No, it would still be wrong.
I:Why do you think that?
R:Cause they know they did something wrong, even if nobody else knows about it they know that they did something wrong and it will catch up to them eventually.
I:What kinds of consequences do you mean when you say there are bad consequences, what do you mean?
R:Well there’s jail or die or get shot or something, or anything really.
I:What uh, earlier you said you felt, things that are right or wrong you said you could sort of feel, where do you think those feelings come from?
R:I really don’t know.  But it’s hard to tell from right or wrong and I don’t really know where they come from.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:I don’t think so.
I:For example, would stealing be always wrong?
R:Not always wrong.  Like if you, if you support a family or something, or if you have a little baby and the only way to get formula or something and you don’t have enough money and you steal I could see, but not just to steal for the fun of it.
I:Okay, what about lying?
R:Lying can be bad, but sometimes it can be good. Like if you do something bad, like cheat on your girlfriend or something like that and you lie about it, it wont hurt her but it will hurt you a little bit.  But yeah.
I:Is that what would make the lying wrong that it would hurt you?
R:It would make you realize that you don’t want to do it anymore.
I:Why wouldn’t you want to do it anymore?

I:Uh-huh, where do you think that comes from?
R:How my parents raised me, probably like most of it.
I:Most of it, from your parents?
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Okay, um, let’s see, what do you think makes something right or wrong? Like what do you think it, makes something one or the other?
R:Like the consequences of it, because if you take drugs and stuff then there’s the, you know, your parents find out and they get in trouble, and the police and like if it’s a good thing then no bad consequences will come from it.
I:Okay, um, do you think that’s always the case?
R:Um, no probably not.
I:No that’s fine, um, let’s see, so is there anything else other than consequences do you think, that is a kind of a indicator of what makes something right or wrong?
R:I mean, it’s like all listed like in the Bible, of course, like you know, that’s like how you’re supposed to know but a lot of people don’t go by that, so.
I:Do you think the Bible is always right or do you think that sometimes it’s wrong, or do you think that it’s all up to interpretation or what do you think about that?
R:Um, I guess since it was like written a long time ago that it can be like interpreted a little bit differently.
I:Okay.
R:But mostly it’s like, that’s what’s right and that’s what’s wrong.
I:Okay so you think the Bible is a pretty reliable source for knowing what’s right and wrong?
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Okay.  Let’s see, um, when you’re faced with a situation where it’s tough to know what’s right and wrong to do, how do you decide what to do?  Do you do anything in particular or think anything in particular?
R:Well, what would my Mom say .  Um, usually like what my parents would think or what my really good friends think cause I have some friends that like are really good Christians and what would they say of me doing this or.
I:Do you think your religious beliefs influence how you decide to do things a lot, or, or not so much?

R:How do you decide what’s good and bad, right and wrong?
I:Mmhmm
R:I think from how you’re brought up is a lot of it.  What your parents tell you and how your friends say you act and it’s just social norms of where you live and stuff like that.
I:in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I would say it’s pretty easy.
I:And has deciding between right and wrong, gotten easier or harder for you in the past couple of years?
R:I think it’s gotten a lot easier.  It’s harder maybe in high school, there’s so many people that are wanting to pull you in the wrong direction and don’t care about you enough and as you get older you just learn to pick friends who really care about you or want you to do well and want you to succeed.
I:Have your views about what’s wrong or right changed in the last few years at all?
R:I don’t think so, not a lot.  Just making the right decisions more, not caring as much for what other people think.  But I don’t think that my views have been totally skewed, I don’t think that they’ve changed that much over the past couple of years.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think a little bit of your own personal beliefs, but a lot with, I mean obviously the law defines that for you.  And for some people, religion defines that for them. I think all of that society, kinda tells you what’s right and wrong.
I:So is it rules and laws then that define right and wrong in general?
R:To a point, yes, but there are some things that of course, that you can only decide what’s right and wrong. And of course the law tells you not to go out and steal, obviously stealing is wrong. But there are certain things, personal things, that you may think are right and wrong and that’s up to you.
I:How do you know?
R:I think that it just, just the way you’re brought up, just the way you yourself are.  I think that only you can decide what’s good for you. So I dunno exactly how you decide, I think it’s really up to your conscious.
I:so if something is a positive influence—does it have positive or negative consequences? Is that how you decide?
R:I think so to an extent, but sometimes doing the right thing will get you in trouble, so I don’t think you can purely define it on that .

R:In large part from my parents.  Um, from when I was younger.  But the older I get, the more it becomes what the Marine corps believes.  What they believe is what I believe.  Because, in the Marine corps it’s God, country, corps.  You eliminate God since I don’t believe in that and it’s country, corps, family.  If it’s good for the Marine corps it’s good for me.  And that is my society, that’s the society that I’m going to be a part of, and I just want to make sure that we’re taken care of, as a whole.
I:Okay, do you think that this causes any problems for you, not believing in God and being a part of the Marine corps, or?
R:Um, no, I really don’t, because I can do anything for God whether he exists or not, it doesn’t matter.  If the Marine corps tells me to do it, I can do it, it doesn’t matter what I believe.  You have to put that aside for the better good, or the bigger good of everyone.
I:So do you think the Marine corps is the best group to belong to as far as morals go?
R:I guess that depends on who you are.  For me, yes.  For other people, probably not.  For those that are extremely opposed to war, I definitely don’t recommend the military at all.
I:Um, so how do you, how do you negotiate those things, with lots of people, say, disagreeing with you?
R:I don’t.  It causes a lot of trouble.  Um, that’s one reason I choose to associate with Marines.  I don’t even really hang out with people that are in other branches of the military because it causes problems.  You get into the whole ego trip of who’s better.  Who’s right and wrong depends on who you are and what you believe.  I think, there again, right and wrong depends on the person.  Someone who is totally opposed to war, I can understand where they’re coming from, doesn’t mean I agree with it.
I:Okay, so you talked a little bit about what’s right for you and what’s right for greater society, for you personally, what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, I know it sounds very brainwashed, and regimented, but there again, if it’s good for the Marine corps, it’s good for me.
I:Can you think of some things, some examples of what would be good for the Marine corps, what kind of rules?
R:Of course, more money, better equipment, means that my job’s gonna be easier.  Better equipment means that less of my brothers and sisters, less Marines will die, fewer will die in war.  Um, God forbid there be a war.  If it’s good for them, it’s good for me.  If we get more money, then pay increases, I get more money, I can retire sooner.  Just, things like that.  Of course it’s about me getting ahead, but on the whole it’s about the Marine corps, getting ahead and doing well.
I:Okay.  Um, let’s see.  So what do you think about war, considering that, it’s, it’s a group that you feel very close to that’s put at risk by war, the act of war.
R:War in itself isn’t necessary but by human nature, it is.  Because we are selfish and we’re mean spirited and we’re not all good.  We’re just not.  I am an American through and through, I am blue-blooded American, and I want my country to be safe.  I want my people to be safe and I want my grandchildren to live in America, the way I know it.  A good place. Anybody that threatens that needs to be dealt with and that’s what I think. If it’s by force, by war, then so be it.
I:Who do you think has the right to make those kinds of decisions, on whether something is threatening enough to go to war over?
R:It doesn’t really matter who I think is, who I know is, is the President of the United States.  He is the Commander in Chief of all military branches and so he’s gonna make the final call.  I, at this point, agree with him, I think that we need to go in and deal with the situations that are happening right now.  But there again, I hope it can be done for the right reasons and not for maybe reasons that people think he’s doing it.
I:Okay, so do you think that um, you have trust in the position of being, of being president, or do you think there could be presidents that you would not agree with, or that you don’t necessarily trust to make the right decision.
R:There probably, are I can think of a lot of people that I would not want to be President of the United States of America.  But if they were and me being in the Marine corps, I would still follow those orders because it comes down to who writes the check and there you go, that’s who writes it.","In large part from my parents.

R:I guess it’s just what my mother has taught me along the way and my whole family and it kind of goes back to the “If your grandmother wouldn’t like it, then maybe you shouldn’t be doing it.” You just know, I don’t know how you know. I guess it depends on how you’re raised but I know what’s right and wrong because I believe that what’s right and wrong is the same as what my mother and grandmother have taught me and if they both agree on whether something is right or wrong then I know that they’re right.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Easy.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Easier.
I:Why?
R:I’ve always known what was right or wrong. It was just whether or not I was going to choose to do the right or wrong thing. Three years ago, I wouldn’t have cared if it was right or wrong, I would have known but I still would have done what I wanted to do. Now I’m with the opinion that I know if it is right or wrong and if it is wrong then I am not going to do it.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:It kind of—there are just some things that aren’t laws of the land that are wrong or right, because no one said they were wrong or right, they just are one or the other, and then there are other things that maybe are regional, cultural or just depending on your family and how you were raised. So aside from those laws of the land I think that just are or are not, my family and the way I was raised to determine what is right and wrong.
I:So for the things that are sort of like set in stone, wrong and right, how do we know like, which things are those and which things are the relative things?
R:I don’t know, you just know. I don’t care who you are or where you live, if you murder someone for the sake of killing them for no good reason, that’s wrong. I don’t think anyone unless they have a mental, you know, instability or probably mentally disagree with the fact that killing someone for the pure pleasure of it is not the right thing to do but I guess one of those gray areas is when someone is breaking into your house and they’re trying to rape your wife or hurt your children or you know, hurt you, and you kill them, that’s not murder, that’s defense so, is it right to kill someone? No, it’s not right but it is more right to protect your life and your family but then it’s wrong to stop someone form hurting you.
I:So do you think when people like, if somebody were to murder another person, do you think that they’re like broadcasting knowledge they know is right and wrong or do you think that some people just like …
R:I just think that’s unfair, they don’t care.
I:Do you think everybody knows those things?
R:I do. I think so and I think it’s just total apathy and they just don’t care, they’re going to do what they want to do even if they, you know, they’re pleasure principle, do what feels good or do what you want to do, just because.
I:Do you think it’s the consequences of something that makes it wrong?
R:No. Because I know as a teenager, and as the younger adult that I am now, consequences didn’t matter, you know, when I lived at home as a teenager, if I did this then I would get in trouble, but it didn’t matter because I would do it anyway and I’d just say, well if I do then I’m going to have to suffer the consequences and if it’s worth it, yeah, do it anyway. I don’t think consequences—they’re what you do to try to either rehabilitate so the person doesn’t do it again or just prevent them from doing it again but I don’t think that they directly relate, really.
I:So do you think it’s like, your feelings about whether something is right or wrong,  like discriminate or … how do we know?
R:I thinks it’s just born into us like … we know we have to eat to  live, nobody tell us that, you just know, you have to breathe to stay alive, there are some things that are innate, they are born through, you know, generations that just aren’t what they are.
I:But do you think that there’s something that are culturally relative?
R:Yeah, definitely. It just depends. Some things that I think wrong other people might not. An example of that is using the word “GD”. I don’t like that word, I won’t get it at all, I think that that is not a good thing to say. Is it because I’m religious and I believe in God? Yes. If you don’t believe in God or you are not religious then that is just another word like any of the other four-letter words that we have there. So I believe that for any—I guess for any Christian that is a wrong thing to say, for anyone else that they’re not, then it doesn’t directly pertain that they’re if don’t believe the same things that I do.
I:At the end of the day, like how do you make the distinction between the culturally agreed and the absolute right and wrong things. Is it hard to tell the difference?
R:I don’t try to tell the difference, you know, I don’t worry about whether this is one of those things that just is throughout the world or whether or not it’s something that my mom taught me when I was a kid because what matters to me directly is whether it’s right or wrong, not why it’s right or wrong or who said it was. It’s just whether or not it is.
I:Where did you acquire your moral views?
R:My mom, my family.","I guess it’s just what my mother has taught me along the way and my whole family and it kind of goes back to the “If your grandmother wouldn’t like it, then maybe you shouldn’t be doing it.” You just know, I don’t know how you know. I guess it depends on how you’re raised but I know what’s right and wrong because I believe that what’s right and wrong is the same as what my mother and grandmother have taught me and if they both agree on whether something is right or wrong then I know that they’re right. Easy. Easier. I’ve always known what was right or wrong. It was just whether or not I was going to choose to do the right or wrong thing. Three years ago, I wouldn’t have cared if it was right or wrong, I would have known but I still would have done what I wanted to do. Now I’m with the opinion that I know if it is right or wrong and if it is wrong then I am not going to do it.  It kind of—there are just some things that aren’t laws of the land that are wrong or right, because no one said they were wrong or right, they just are one or the other, and then there are other things that maybe are regional, cultural or just depending on your family and how you were raised. So aside from those laws of the land I think that just are or are not, my family and the way I was raised to determine what is right and wrong. I don’t know, you just know. I don’t care who you are or where you live, if you murder someone for the sake of killing them for no good reason, that’s wrong. I don’t think anyone unless they have a mental, you know, instability or probably mentally disagree with the fact that killing someone for the pure pleasure of it is not the right thing to do but I guess one of those gray areas is when someone is breaking into your house and they’re trying to rape your wife or hurt your children or you know, hurt you, and you kill them, that’s not murder, that’s defense so, is it right to kill someone? No, it’s not right but it is more right to protect your life and your family but then it’s wrong to stop someone form hurting you. I just think that’s unfair, they don’t care. I do. I think so and I think it’s just total apathy and they just don’t care, they’re going to do what they want to do even if they, you know, they’re pleasure principle, do what feels good or do what you want to do, just because. No. Because I know as a teenager, and as the younger adult that I am now, consequences didn’t matter, you know, when I lived at home as a teenager, if I did this then I would get in trouble, but it didn’t matter because I would do it anyway and I’d just say, well if I do then I’m going to have to suffer the consequences and if it’s worth it, yeah, do it anyway. I don’t think consequences—they’re what you do to try to either rehabilitate so the person doesn’t do it again or just prevent them from doing it again but I don’t think that they directly relate, really. I thinks it’s just born into us like … we know we have to eat to  live, nobody tell us that, you just know, you have to breathe to stay alive, there are some things that are innate, they are born through, you know, generations that just aren’t what they are. Yeah, definitely. It just depends. Some things that I think wrong other people might not. An example of that is using the word “GD”. I don’t like that word, I won’t get it at all, I think that that is not a good thing to say. Is it because I’m religious and I believe in God? Yes. If you don’t believe in God or you are not religious then that is just another word like any of the other four-letter words that we have there. So I believe that for any—I guess for any Christian that is a wrong thing to say, for anyone else that they’re not, then it doesn’t directly pertain that they’re if don’t believe the same things that I do. I don’t try to tell the difference, you know, I don’t worry about whether this is one of those things that just is throughout the world or whether or not it’s something that my mom taught me when I was a kid because what matters to me directly is whether it’s right or wrong, not why it’s right or wrong or who said it was. It’s just whether or not it is.  My mom, my family.","The respondent makes decisions based on the teachings of her mother and grandmother, believing that right and wrong are clear-cut and rooted in her upbringing, while also emphasizing that doing the right thing, even when difficult, is essential for personal integrity and that she would rely on her mother's guidance in uncertain situations."

So how would you say you normally decide or know what’s good or bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I guess you just know what not to do and your conscious makes you have to think about it.
I:So you just know?  Is it like, you know it, like there are rules that you know in your mind, or is it a feeling, or –
R:I guess it’s a feeling that you get, that you know.  Like I know this is not right.
I:So in general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Pretty easy.
I:Okay.  Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last two years?
R:No, not really.
I:Okay.  Have your views about what’s right and wrong changed in the last two years?
R:No.
I:So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong, like what about it?
R:What about –
I:What about something that makes it right or wrong?
R:I guess the outcome.
I:Okay.  And what kinds of like outcomes would you say makes something wrong?  Can you give me an example?
R:I would say if you’re going to do something and you know it was wrong, the consequences.  Like, if you’re going to do something, like, say if you’re going to hop the train, and you know you’ll get a ticket for it but you do it anyway.  Or –
I:Why would that be wrong, to hop the train, what if you didn’t get caught, would it still be wrong?
R:It wouldn’t be wrong if you didn’t get caught.
I:Okay.  So you think that it’s the getting caught that makes something wrong?
R:Yes and no.  It depends on the situation.
I:Any idea what it might depend on?
R:I guess, given a situation, I mean, something as simple as a train, they charge too much anyway, so it’s not nothing to hop a train.
I:Okay.  Can you think of a situation where it would be wrong even if you didn’t get caught?
R:I would say, I guess, lying.
I:Okay.  How come that’s wrong even if you don’t get caught?
R:Because you know it’s wrong.  I mean, you might not have or have a guilty conscious, but other person believes it’s the truth.  So you deceive another person.
I:Okay.  How come that’s different from jumping the train, any idea?
R:You’re not deceiving no one by jumping the train.
I:Let’s see.  Where would you say you have gotten your views on what is right and wrong?
R:My mother.
I:Okay.  Is there any particular like place or person you feel like she got her ideas about right and wrong from?
R:My grandmother, my grandfather.","I guess you just know what not to do and your conscious makes you have to think about it. I guess it’s a feeling that you get, that you know.

I:You talked about drugs.  Is there anything else that you would consider like, that you think would be bad, or anything that you would consider that would be good.
R:Bad, ah, I think maybe sports, athletes get paid way too much, I mean, give the kid, Labraun James $90 million before he even steps on the court, the court is, wow, that’s like, astonishing nowadays.  But, but if you have that ability to do that, but.  What’s right and wrong?

R:Morally good, I think morally good would be ah, focusing straight on my education, I mean, that’s, I mean nowadays I heard you cannot barely, if you have a high school diploma you can barely get, I don’t know a 30-some thousand dollar job or twenty, not even that.

How do you normally decide, or know, what is good or bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Morally?  I guess that’s something that I was raised with.  I go with my instinct.  And not only that, if my decision, if it’s going to hurt somebody, I don’t want to, I mean, I’ll make the right decision.  I don’t like hurting people.  I don’t like, I like, I want people to, I mean, be happy, and I feel bad for a lot of people.

R:I think it’s easy to decide between right and wrong.  Yeah.
I:Now, has deciding between right and wrong gotten harder or easier over the past two years?
R:I think it’s gotten easier the past two years because I’ve found more of who, I’ve grown up a little.  I’ve gotten this new truck, and I got a more responsibilities, about to enter the workforce.  You’d think that would be harder for me, but I think it’s easier because I’ve grown up, like I said.
I:Have your views changed in the past couple of years?
R:About?
I:Like your moral views?
R:I guess yes and no.  Morally this is wrong, morally, I used to think, like I say, I used to go out and just have fun, do things.  But I’ve kind of grown up about that I guess you could say.
I:To you, what is it that makes something right or wrong?
R:What makes?
I:Yeah.
R:What was that again?
I:What makes something right or wrong?  How do you know if something is right or wrong?
R:I guess just the instinct you have as a human.  You know this is right, this is wrong.
I:I mean is it the way it feels?  Or is it rules or law? Or is the consequences of that action?
R:I think it’s the consequences and the effects that will happen.  To me, I think a guy upstairs is watching me all the time.  And I think it’s being noted, “Oh he stole this, or this happened.”  I think it’s the consequences.  If I go ahead and, if I go ahead and do something will I get arrested for it or, you know, I’m always thinking two steps ahead, I’m always trying to look out for myself.  I think it’s consequence-wise.  The effects, yeah.
I:Where do you think you’ve acquired your moral views from?
R:Mmm…
I:Where do they come from?
R:From my parents.  I grew up in a, I grew up in a great household.  If I ever make it big one day as an actor.

R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  So how, what kind of ex—how, what, what kind of experience, what kind of reaction, I guess, would tell you that something is wrong as opposed to something being right?
R:Mm, just from the stuff I’ve been told and based on the knowledge I have.
I:Okay, um, how do you decide or know what is good and bad or right and wrong in life?  If you had a decision to make how do you decide?
R:Um, I get a gut feeling.
I:Okay.  Where do you think that feeling comes from?
R:From knowing that it’s wrong.
I:Okay.  Um, can you give me any specific examples of things that, like decisions that you’ve had to make about whether something was right and wrong and how you maybe made it?
R:Um.
I:Just one.  Take a second.

I:It has.  Any reason it’s gotten easier for you?

I:How it makes you feel?
R:--inside and then like if it, if it affects other people.
I:Okay.  When you say, how it makes you feel, could you describe that a little bit for me?
R:Um, just kind of like a gut feeling, just like you can, it feels like a little voice in the back of your head saying like you know you shouldn’t be doing it.
I:Okay, and where does that voice come from, do you think?
R:Um, in my religion, we, it’s called like the Holy Ghost.
I:Okay, and then you also mentioned its affects on other people, makes something right or wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:And what, what type of affects on other people are you thinking about there?
R:Just cause like some of your actions like they have consequences and they don’t always affect you, they affect the people around you, too.
I:Okay.  So, in other words, the things you do should be influenced by that kind of gut feeling or that voice in the back of your head that you were talking about, but also the consequences they have for other people, it sounds like.
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Anything else?
R:Um, not that I can think of.
I:Okay.  Are there any actions that you think are just wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Um, like you shouldn’t do them at all?
I:Correct.

R:No.  It’s pretty easy.
I:Has it gotten easy or harder over the past few years?
R:It’s gotten easier.

I:So what kind of things—like what kind of things have changed? Like what kind of things are you aware of that you weren’t?
R:Money.  Because I mean obviously when you’re younger, you don’t really like, “Oh, I got to pay the bills.”

R:I have no idea.  How you’re raised?
I:So what if a person was raised to believe that like, you know, stealing or something like that was okay? You know, let’s say they grew up and their parents were criminals or whatever they grew up with. Would that be right?
R:No.
I:So is there like a standard of like right and wrong that goes beyond how we’re raised or…
R:It seems like it.  Like we’re installed with it at birth or something.
I:So does that mean that everybody should have the same sets of right and wrong?
R:I don’t know.

Probably, I mean, I think if you feel in your gut that you shouldn’t do it, then it’s wrong, but if you feel like, you know, like you have like innate, I think really do have an innate feeling of know what’s wrong but you want to do it anyways, and you do it, whether, depending on your personality too, if you really wanna just do it, you don’t care, you just do it, but I think deep down you really do know,  you have a feeling about it.  So.
I:are there any actions that are always wrong, in themselves, or not?
R:see, I don’t think, I really don’t think like that, you know.  Maybe probably taking advantage of somebody or like, you know, like taking advantage of somebody is, yeah, that’s probably wrong all the time, or you know, cheating somebody out of money or something, yeah.
I:so what makes these things wrong?  Is it that somebody else’s involved or…?
R:I think it’s just totally dishonest.  So, yeah.
I:so where have you acquired your moral views?
R:my dad, especially my dad.  And somewhat, you know my mom.  But I tried a lot to just take my own influence, I mean, I get a lot of different views on things about what’s right and wrong from like, I went to a private catholic high school, I went to all public and then to high school.  So I had influence from there, from my parents, and we got all these different views on what’s right and what’s wrong and, so I just took them in but then I think to myself, what do I really think?  So I kind of just judge, I try to base it on what I think.","well the things I’ve learned from like my parents and like, I guess actually from my dad, he’s a very honest person so he’s taught me a lot about you know, right and wrong, like what’s, what you, you know, he always tells me you have to follow you know, your heart, what really you feel.  Like sometimes you don’t actually feel like this is right or wrong but it’s like, they, my parents, especially my dad has really guided me in that direction.  So I judge how, I just have a kind of natural, you know instinct, oh I don’t think this is right so I do it or don’t do it. no it’s pretty much, cause especially the things that I know are wrong but I want to do anyways, it’s hard.  Yeah. definitely harder. cause there’s a lot more things now that I’ve been exposed to. yeah, a lot more freedom, a lot more things I could do, you know, are you kidding me?  I’ll be going to *Manhattan like all last semester when I had my semester.  Every night my friend Megan and I would go clubbing, get drunk, meet guys, we’d all come back to my apartment and crash, I mean crazy!  We’d get drunk every night, it was great!  oh, that’s a good question.  Um, hmmm.  Probably, I mean, I think if you feel in your gut that you shouldn’t do it, then it’s wrong, but if you feel like, you know, like you have like innate, I think really do have an innate feeling of know what’s wrong but you want to do it anyways, and you do it, whether, depending on your personality too, if you really wanna just do it, you don’t care, you just do it, but I think deep down you really do know,  you have a feeling about it.  So. see, I don’t think, I really don’t think like that, you know.  Maybe probably taking advantage of somebody or like, you know, like taking advantage of somebody is, yeah, that’s probably wrong all the time, or you know, cheating somebody out of money or something, yeah. I think it’s just totally dishonest.  So, yeah.  my dad, especially my dad.  And somewhat, you know my mom.

So I kind of just judge, I try to base it on what I think.","The respondent makes decisions based on the guidance of their honest father, their own intuition about right and wrong, and acknowledges the influence of their experiences and social interactions, while also reflecting on the consequences of their actions and the relativity of morality shaped by upbringing and personal beliefs.","I:How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Well especially probably what my parents taught and everyone grows up differently so different values are important or les important.  That and generally what my first initial thinking is.  It’s weird, especially like informed consciousness that is a big part in like Catholicism and we have it informed conscience which I think is kind of a little bogus, but at the same time I do base it on what I generally think is good, and then also what I have been taught as well.  I just put those together to make as best a decision as I can.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Generally easy, it has gotten easier, because before I used to know what was right but not want to do it and now that I have more discipline and I know what is right I just do that.  And then I do it.
I:And so you say it has gotten easier for you, why has it gotten easier for you?
R:I am trying to be less selfish, I can definitely be a selfish person, so I try to be less selfish and not do what I want, but actually do what…most of my decision making I honestly do think my dad taught me and he is the most amazingly honest person I have ever met in my life so he taught me a lot of good values and important things to be an overall good person.  You don’t need to lie and do all those things, and so I really follow a lot of what he says.
I:Do you think that your views changed besides moving away from being less selfish…your views have changed on things the last couple of years?
R:Slightly, I would say a whole lot.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Usually it is an initial feeling.  I think everyone has their initial feelings about something and usually those first feelings are right.
I:What kinds of feelings like repulsion or an unsettled feeling or what?
R:Yeah, I think sometimes you get like a…initially your first reaction to something isn’t always…I know that sometimes I thought wrong about someone and found out later as things go on, but initially I guess you could think something is right or wrong by not feeling very good about it.  Like maybe a deep feeling that is kind of like something seems off to you, that I will sometimes base it on that.
I:And in your view where do you think those feeling come from?
R:I think some of my mom’s influence too.  She has pretty good…
I:Like religious beliefs and that, or…?
R:Yeah, a lot of religious influence for sure.
I:Is that what you were talking about earlier about conscience development?
R:Yeah.  Like informed consciousness, but it is not completely that, it is like a unique combination of that and values from like my dad and my step mom that they have taught me over the years.
I:So tell me a little bit, why do you think the way you grew up made you think that?  It sounds like your mom gave you pretty much this is the way the church or the Bible or God or whatever…and you need to act this way, and your dad and step mom gave you this general moral guideline.
R:I have actually thought about this before, say my dad and my step mom weren’t even around and say that they passed away and it was just living with my mom, then more than likely I would probably think like she does and I am actually glad that I didn’t have that because I like the combination  of thinking both ways, and I think you are who you hang out with or who you are around but everyone honestly has their own personal opinions and ideas and so those are awesome so  yeah, if I had grown up thinking a little bit differently it would have been different decision making and morals.
I:Now would you say that primarily your moral views come from your mom and dad or from some other source in addition to them?
R:I think other sources in addition because actually all my best friends growing up, I was really close friends with their parents too and they contributed a lot to my life as well so I like to take a little bit of everything and bring it together, and not everybody does.  Everyone takes what they have been taught differently and approach things differently.  They are a unique individual person, so I actually do believe that things can be very relative to situations.","Well especially probably what my parents taught and everyone grows up differently so different values are important or les important.

I:Um, situations in which you, okay, this is something that was right for you and this is something that was wrong and how you decided that.

I:Why not, like what do you, why not, what factors into your mind when you think about that?
R:Um, I just know that it really won’t help the, it won’t help anything, um, I wouldn’t do it just for fun because I would think okay, I guess I would think about the consequences.
I:Okay.
R:Um,
I:Consequences of how like it would affect you or what?

R:Just – yeah, dumb stuff like that.
I:Have your views about right and wrong changes over the last couple of years?

I:Can you give examples again of what’s?
R:Just, like, that whole, you know, just in any means necessary having fun, like, just dumb like someone’s got a CD, and you want his CD, and you just take it.  Just dumb little menial…
I:Okay, so the big stuff, you’re saying, is –
R:Yeah. That’s simple.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I would just – I think right and wrong, everyone uses their opinion, like –
I:Like, is it maybe just consequences of your actions, or is it how you feel about it, or is it, like, laws, or rules?
R:What do you mean?  Like, are those, like, those factors?
I:Yeah, like why would something be wrong, and in that case that you were in that car, and what?
R:Mostly the repercussions of what would happen if we were to get stopped or something.
I:Okay, so maybe the consequences you’d say are the –
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, and what kinds of consequences makes it – you know, is it just because it’s legal, or are there other kinds of –
R:In that particular situation it was a legal factor, like, and my safety was a factor, but I don’t know.  Each situation really has its own particular factors that determine how it’s –
I:Do you think the consequences are probably the most important factor?
R:That would really depend on the situation too because, like, the consequences, like, falling down because you had too many drinks.  That would be, like – but other things – factors more than that.
I:What sort of other…?
R:Not really sure.
I:Where have you acquired your own moral views from?
R:Just from everywhere.  Just from what I – what you read, and what you find to be interesting or something, like, if you read a book, and you really – you know, it really catches you, and you’re gonna pick a little bit of that up, and it’s gonna shape you, you know. Pretty much everything’s about – people you talk to or something that really had, like, a meaningful conversation with you.  It would just stick with you, and shape you, and –

R:Just things like, I’ve experienced in life, just certain things I won't do, morals.
I:How do you, like in terms of deciding what's right and wrong, is that generally easy or hard.
R:It's usually pretty easy. I guess it all depends on the person, you know. For me, it's pretty easy to. I guess it just depends on what it is.
I:In general, in the situations that you've found yourself in, the last few years, maybe last two, three years, has it been easy or hard, has it been getting easier, or getting harder to figure out right and wrong?
R:Easier.
I:Why would you say? Do you never find yourself struggling, or anything to do the right thing?
R:I guess, it's becoming easier as I'm getting older to get in less trouble. I guess there are situations where I do the wrong thing, but afterwards, I guess, you know, it wouldn’t be a situation of what you should have done.
I:Cool, so you feel like you’re learning?
R:Yeah, it's all kind of a learning thing.
I:Have your views of right and wrong changed over the past couple of years?
R:Probably. Like, I got in big trouble with drinking and driving, and I never really paid attention to that. And now, that's definitely an issue in my life. Definitely  learning.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I guess it's a person's background, things you've been taught. You can be taught something wrong, and think it's right. And then, it kind of goes by...
I:How do you figure out, if you're taught something that's wrong, how do you come to find out that it's wrong? What is it about it that's wrong?
R:I don't know. I guess you wouldn't know it was wrong, if you were taught that all of your life.
I:We live in a society with different people, with different ideas about what is right and wrong, how do we... Some people would say it’s consequences, is it the result of an action, if it makes things work out with you, then it's right?  Other people say it's how you feel, it's how you feel about it, and that's all that matters.
R:A mix of both, it can advance you, but it's wrong, and it could advance you, but maybe if you do it. Go on what you're feeling, but try and do for yourself in a way, but not to hurt anybody.
I:Some people said that there were rules and principles that were absolutely wrong?  You think that's possible?
R:Probably. There's definitely a lot of things you shouldn't do.
I:Do you have an example?
R:Drinking and driving. Treating other people bad. Pretty much, like, hurting other people.
I:Why is that wrong?
R:I don't want to be messed with.
I:You wouldn't want that to happen to you?
R:Yeah.
I:Do you have any idea of where you acquired your moral views from?
R:Probably my parents, and their parents.
I:Do they talk to you a lot about, when you were growing up or now, about how to figure out right and wrong, about what you should and shouldn't do?

R:How it would affect someone else.  If it would affect someone else negatively or positively, that’s how I would determine what’s good or bad.
I:Um hm.  In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:For the most part, it’s pretty easy.
I:Ok.  So what makes it easy?
R:Just because – I mean, like I said, I was brought up really well.  I was raised really well, so being in a situation – it doesn’t really take long for me to understand what I need to do to make a positive impact rather than, like, go do something wrong or something bad.
I:Is deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:It’s gotten easier.
I:Why is that?
R:Just because I’ve matured a lot more, so I don’t really have to think twice about doing something or reflecting on something.  I just kinda know instinctively what I need to do.
I:Have your views about right and wrong changed much in the past two years?
R:Not really.
I:Ok.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:What makes something right or wrong?
I:Yeah.  Tough question, I know.
R:Yeah.  I guess, like, what I was talking about before – whether or not it has a good impact or negative impact, how it affects me, how it affects someone else –
I:Um hm.  So what would be a good or a negative impact?  Like, what would be a good impact?  What would be a negative one?
R:A good impact if it makes someone else happy, if it makes myself happy – a negative one would be just the opposite.  If it hurts someone in any way or if it’s detrimental to my health, my well-being, things like that.
I:So in the party situation – I don’t know.  You giving a guy your number – what would be the positive or negative impact?
R:I mean, positive I guess would be that they’re not getting rejected.  Negative would be just the fact that I’m, I guess, opening myself up to someone who I don’t really know that well.  And I mean, people are – you can’t tell what type of person someone is by having a 20-minute, 30-minute conversation with them.  So I guess in the long run, that might hurt me.

R:How do I know what’s right and what’s wrong, um, that little voice in my head is just kind of like telling me this is not good.  Um, the way I do it is I think okay, if my mom was here, would I want to do this.  Would I want her to see me doing this.  Because I want my mom to trust me and respect me and so I don’t want,
I:You don’t want to do anything that’s gonna let her down.
R:Yeah.  Or let myself down.
I:So what makes one thing right and another thing wrong, would you say? How, what’s the dividing line?  How do you know?  You had a feeling, there’s a little voice inside, but what I want to know is where that voice comes from.
R:How do I know, um,  I, well, I try not to do things that I, I mean, ever since after that, you know, I haven’t been in a situation like that or I mean as big as that, but if I’m trying to make a decision between right and wrong I’m sort of like okay, how am I gonna feel about myself after I do this.
I:Right.
R:And that’s how I decide.
I:And you said earlier how’s your mom gonna feel?
R:And now it’s like how am I gonna feel about myself, you know after I do this, am I gonna feel like a bad person like I shouldn’t have done that, am I gonna go home and be like why did I do that or am I gonna feel good about myself after doing this, like was this a good thing to do, I’m glad I did or didn’t do that.
I:Do you think you were born with that instinct, do you think you learned it from the people around you or from something else, from what you were taught?
R:Um, I mean I’m sure I was taught it early on, I mean it feels like I was born with it but I think, I mean I was always just a really, when I was a little kid, I was always just a real well behaved little kid, I didn’t throw like a lot of temper tantrums on stores and stuff and so I’m guessing that’s just something I was born with, I mean I never wanted to embarrass anyone or make a scene or do anything wrong.
I:You said that you thought you were taught it early on, okay,
R:But now that I think about it I probably wasn’t because I mean,
I:So you think your parents would just allow you to be who you unfolded into being?
R:Yes.  My mom has always said, you know I don’t want to mold you, I don’t, cause I think her mom tried to kind of like make her into someone that she wasn’t and um, she’s always saying I don’t want to make you into someone you’re not, I want you to just be who you are and do what you want to do, but, yeah, I think my parents just let me kind of become who I want to be.
I:And so their ideas of right and wrong are based on how, what you think is right and wrong?
R:Um, I guess, yeah.
I:Give me a few things that you’d say are wrong.
R:Um, teasing people.
I:Teasing people.
R:I really don’t like it when people tease people.
I:Why?
R:Because it’s mean and no one deserves that.

I:You don’t want other people to feel bad.
R:Yeah.  I mean,
I:Why not?

R:Morals and beliefs from both what I’ve seen.
I:Uh-huh?
R:Um, cuz of the area I live in, it’s just a really bad area.
I:Okay.
R:Um, and, me and my friends call it the “Wanna Be War zone,” which is actually worse than the actual war zone.
I:Okay.
R:Um, cuz they try harder.  And um, and pretty much my beliefs like Christianity.
I:Okay, um, in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?

I:Can you give me an example of sometime maybe when it was hard?
R:Um.
I:Or the kinds of things that it’s bitter hard?  Maybe you just gotta?
R:Just, I can’t really think of any instances right now, but like in the past, it’s cuz I use to have an anger issue and that always used to come into a, effect and it’s always been hard to kind of control area.  I did it not really well.
I:Okay, um, has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?

I:Why is that?

I:Not recently, okay, um, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Cause and effect, pretty much.
I:What do you mean by that?
R:If like the consequence, will it have consequence to it, stuff like that, like, I’ll go back to like we’ll go back to drugs and sex for instance, you know, the reason that I think, you know doing that is bad doing drugs is bad is because you lose control over your actions and you don’t, you’re not able to control what you do.  Sex you know, that that goes a long way, you know, you, there’s the whole fact of pregnancy, there’s the whole fact of, uh, disease, there’s the whole, that whole fact.  Like, I said cause and effect.
I:So, you, you also mentioned sort of consequences, I’m curious, so, what kinds of consequences would make something wrong, like is there, are there certain kinds of consequence?
R:Actually, that’s a good point to bring up because some good things bring consequences, but it’s, it’s mostly, does it help you and help other people, or does it hurt you and hurt other people?
I:Okay, so, when you say that um, the kinds of consequences that make something wrong would be if it hurts you or hurts other people.
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:I don’t, can you repeat that one more time?
I:Sure, are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves?
R:In my eyes, yes, but then again there’s always the fact of that what is the word I’m looking for, that there’s that, always that fact of like, there’s things that it can help people, like, like I said, for drugs, you know, let’s take marijuana for example.  Some doctors give it out as a prescription for pain.  Is that wrong?  I don’t know, I don’t know if I have the right to say or not cuz I’ve never had that.
I:Well, so a second ago you said in your eyes, yes, there are things that are always wrong in and of themselves, so what some examples of those kinds of things, just for you like, tell me what you think.
R:Well like sex before marriage and I think personally like I said with drugs, they’re bad.  Um, and the reason that  I’m so strong on, on, I don’t know if you can tell but the reason I’m so strong on it is cuz I see how it’s messed up my dad. And my uncle, cuz they’re twin brothers and they were in, they were in the penitentiary for awhile and they, now that that’s you know, doing all of the heavy stuff, they’ve, have heart trouble, they have just stuff like that that’s really bad.  And I just see that and that’s why I think, that’s why in my eyes, I see that it’s always wrong.
I:Always, to kill.  What makes that wrong?
R:Because who are you to take anoth-, to take person’s life?  To take something that doesn’t belong to you?
I:So is it kinda like theft in that sense?
R:Yeah.
I:So what makes, what makes theft wrong?  I mean is it, I mean.
R:Because, because who are you to take what doesn’t belong to you.
I:Do you think that it’s wrong because of the consequences or do you think it’s wrong for some other reason?
R:I think it’s wrong for a number of reasons, but mostly consequence for you and that person.
I:In, in what terms, what?
R:In terms as I don’t know I’ll just use terms as financial wise.  Let’s say that this person paid I don’t know, let’s say $50,000 on the computer.  You take that computer, they spent all their saving on it.  Now they have no money.  Consequence is for you, you could be caught cuz it is illegal. Consequence for them, they might be not be able to get another one.
I:Okay, from where have you acquired your moral bel-, moral, moral view, like, where do they come from?
R:Well I consider I’ve seen what, I’ve seen a lot of stuff that I think is right and a lot of stuff that I think is wrong just that’s, I built it from actions I’ve seen and consequences I’ve seen and.","Morals and beliefs from both what I’ve seen. Um, cuz of the area I live in, it’s just a really bad area. Um, and, me and my friends call it the “Wanna Be War zone,” which is actually worse than the actual war zone. Um, cuz they try harder.  And um, and pretty much my beliefs like Christianity. It’s generally easy.  Sometimes it’s hard, but generally, it’s easy. Um. Just, I can’t really think of any instances right now, but like in the past, it’s cuz I use to have an anger issue and that always used to come into a, effect and it’s always been hard to kind of control area.  I did it not really well. It’s gotten easier. Cuz um older and I’m mature and I know why, why I think it’s right and why I think it’s wrong instead of being told what’s right and being told what’s wrong.  Cause and effect, pretty much. If like the consequence, will it have consequence to it, stuff like that, like, I’ll go back to like we’ll go back to drugs and sex for instance, you know, the reason that I think, you know doing that is bad doing drugs is bad is because you lose control over your actions and you don’t, you’re not able to control what you do.  Sex you know, that that goes a long way, you know, you, there’s the whole fact of pregnancy, there’s the whole fact of, uh, disease, there’s the whole, that whole fact.  Like, I said cause and effect. Actually, that’s a good point to bring up because some good things bring consequences, but it’s, it’s mostly, does it help you and help other people, or does it hurt you and hurt other people? Yeah. I don’t, can you repeat that one more time?

R:Um, how, like it would impact your future.
I:How it would impact your future.
R:Whether near or far future.
I:Okay.  And so how would you, how do you decide what’s a right or wrong impact on your future?
R:Is this gonna hurt me?  Is this gonna um, you know, maybe make my chances of succeeding in life harder?  What’s gonna happen, you know.
I:Okay.  What if, um, what if there’s some, so somebody decides this is, um, you know, it’s good for me to, to do this because it’s gonna help me in the future, but somebody else might be hurt in the process, is that still okay because it’s beneficial for your future?
R:Mm, you have to take into like consideration other people’s futures, too, you can’t, you can’t just say oh this is great for me, sorry you know, you who, you know, lost out.
I:So how does that work, the balance with someone, why, why is it important to take in consideration someone else’s future?
R:Um, because if you do something that affects them then they have to counteract that and it’s gonna come back to bite you.
I:Okay so because it might come back to bite you.  Is there any, any sort of, beyond just making sure you don’t get repercussions, is there any other reason why, I mean, is that the only reason you shouldn’t hurt someone else or is that, that the primary reason?
R:Um, well if you’re gonna you know, mess up their life forever, you kind of take into consideration, well, I, you know, I could have done something else and they would have been fine and I would have been fine, so that has to be taken into consideration.
I:Okay, um, why, you had said earlier you, that you know, that morality is relative, it’s whatever’s right for you, so why do you think what, can you explain your thinking behind that, why do you, why would you say you agree with that statement?

I:So if someone, I mean if someone decides, well I think that, I think it’s right for me to steal this car, so I’m gonna go ahead and steal it cause I think that’s right, is that okay?  Or is that a problem?
R:It’s a problem because it’s affecting the car owner.
I:Okay.
R:Who would not have benefited from that, I mean.
I:So do you think there’s any limits on it, whatever’s right, the, so whatever’s right for you?
R:Yeah.  If it’s gonna hurt someone else.
I:Okay.  So if it hurts someone else, then it’s not right.
R:Right.
I:Okay how, how would you decide whether some thing is gonna hurt someone else?
R:Um, well you think, what would be the consequences if I was in that person’s shoes, what would happen to me?
I:Okay.  So how, how do we know which consequences are good and which consequences are bad?  I mean what makes us, what makes a certain consequence bad?

R:How I grew up, the people I was around.
I:Who had the most influence on that?
R:Probably my friends.
I:Your friends.
R:Yeah.
I:More than your parents, do you think?
R:My parents kind of but I’m probably around my friends more at school.
I:So that’s what shaped how you decide what’s right and wrong.  And what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Can I think about it for a second.
I:That’s fine.
R:I don’t know really, I’m sorry.
I:We’ll get to some examples in a little bit and maybe that’ll help.  But you said earlier, things that, we’re on the question, how would you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life? What are the things that would help you decide if you were in a situation where you had to figure that out?
R:I think kinda if it’s good, it’s bad it affects other people in a bad way, I think it’s the way it affects people whether it’s a right or wrong.
I:The way it affects people.
R:Yeah, if it affects someone bad then it’s a bad decision, but.  I don’t know.
I:Do you have any specific examples of that?
R:Kind of a war, it can affect some people in a good way, some people in a bad way.
I:So what do you think about that?
R:Um, I kind of think it’s, all right but I’m not quite sure on all, everything.
I:Okay, and you would decide, if you were trying to figure out whether you thought the war was a good thing or a bad thing, what, how, what kind of criteria would you use to figure it out?
R:It’s bad that we’re hurting people but it kind of needs to be done cause more people could get hurt. So it’s kind of, you know, do one thing.
I:So it’s sort of the number of people who would be hurt?
R:Yeah.","How I grew up, the people I was around. Probably my friends. Yeah. My parents kind of but I’m probably around my friends more at school. Can I think about it for a second.

Okay, so how do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Whatever makes you feel good.  I mean, not really makes you feel good cause you could do bad stuff that makes you feel good but if it makes you feel good after you do it.
I:Okay, so like consequences of things?
R:Yeah, consequences and the way other people react to you.  If people are proud of you and they are happy with what you did and you feel good about it, you did something good.  If you, like if you did some drugs and you felt good and then after you went like, oh crap.
I:And do you think it’s pretty easy or hard for you to sort of decide whether something is gonna be good or bad?
R:I think it’s easy just because I’ve seen the bad and I’ve seen the good and I can see that line.
I:Okay, so do you think you’re experiences have contributed to your being able to decide?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, um, has it gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Easier.
I:Easier?
R:Yeah.
I:Why is that?
R:Just  and that kind of stuff.
I:Okay, um, so what else makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know for sure, um,
I:Is it just how, just how it feels or consequences, is there any other sort of external factors that make something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know.
I:Okay.  Are there any actions that are always wrong or does it just depend?
R:It just depends on the situation and circumstances.
I:Okay, um, where do you think your ideas of right and wrong come from?
R:My uncle and aunt.
I:Your uncle and aunt?
R:Yeah.
I:Have they been the most influential in that?

R:Oh, I want to say how I feel about it.  Probably just my gut feeling, but that’s not always right.  Kind of questioning my actions-
I:Like you question it?
R:If I do something, yeah, or when people challenge me or I don’t know, I-
I:And do you think it’s an easy or a hard thing for you to decide those things usually?
R:Depends on what it is.  Probably pretty easy, I would say.
I:What about as you get older, do you find that it gets easier or harder as you get older to make those kinds of things?
R:Gets harder because then you get more perspectives and you’re like maybe if I was coming from that angle, maybe it wouldn’t seem such like a good thing.  So the more perspectives you get the more challenging it gets, I think, to make, to come up with a good answer, so.
I:What is it then that makes something right or wrong?  What is it that-?
R:I don’t know.  That’s a hard question, it’s very philosophical.  I want to say something that affects most people positively, but that doesn’t necessarily make it right.

I:Uh-huh, I mean, like with what your parents teach you is right or wrong, you might take that from your parents, or do you think it’s right or wrong just because they say or is it that there’s some other reason that it’s right or wrong?

R:Um, I don’t know, just values that my parents taught me from when I was a kid.  Stuff I picked up from books and whatnot.
I:Like what kind of books?
R:Uh, I read a lot of science fiction, fantasy kind of books.
I:And, give me an example of some sort of, how do you pick up morality from that?
R:I guess it’s just the kind of choices I’d make or something.  Just reading about different characters kind of show you different ways that people think that people would react.  So,
I:What kind of science fiction?
R:Uh, generally fantasy.
I:Like Star Wars?  Or like Lord of the Rings?
R:No, I like the Lord of the Rings stuff
I:You do.
R:Yeah.
I:Did you pick up morality from that?
R:Not from Lord of the Rings.  I tried to pick up that book, I got through about the first 50 pages, and it was too boring.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:I think it’s gotten harder, just cause there’s just so much, that people feel is right but that it’s known that it’s wrong.
I:Give me an example if you can.
R:Just like people smoking or drinking.  Like people know they can do it, and they think it’s fun, but
I:Is it wrong to do those things?
R:Yeah, cause it’s against the law.  Since we’re not 18.
I:Is that the only reason it’s wrong?
R:Yeah, and just cause it’s bad for your health and that kind of stuff.
I:So let’s say, you already said you didn’t smoke, right?
R:Yeah.
I:18, going to pick it up?
R:No.
I:It’s not going to be illegal anymore.
R:Right.  But it’s bad for your health.
I:What about drinking, do you drink?
R:Uh, I’ve dranken a couple times but,
I:Drank a little bit, or drank and got drunk?
R:I drank a little bit, not too much.
I:Um, say you’re 21, I mean drinking isn’t necessarily bad for your health.
R:I think drinking is fine as long as it’s not done in excess where your judgment is impaired,
I:Is it bad to do that?
R:Yes, cause then you
I:Is it wrong to do that?
R:I don’t think it’s that wrong, but I think it’s something that shouldn’t be done just because of the harmful effects that it can have.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it’s more of just the person deciding just how they view things.  I think only a person can decide what’s right or wrong for them.
I:So something could be right for one person but wrong for another person?
R:Yep.  Well the person that’s looking at it, they might think that something’s wrong, it all depends on who’s making the choices, and who’s doing it, that kind of stuff.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Uh, well obviously like killing a person or something.  That’s wrong, no matter how you look at it.
I:Okay.  What else?
R:Just like stealing and anything else that’s harmful to everybody including yourself.  That puts people at risk for getting in trouble and whatnot.
I:Well some people could say well lots of things could be harmful to people and not even know it.  Um, your neighbor could be doing drugs and some, and bring the drug trade to your neighborhood, and so it didn’t actually harm you but eventually it’s going to cause a problem, is that right?
R:Well like drugs and stuff, they do hurt people cause everyone who takes the drugs their decision making is going to be impaired.
I:So drugs would always be wrong.
R:Yeah.
I:So where do you get your moral views from?
R:Uh, I don’t know, just what I decide on.  What I get from what I observe and,","Um, I don’t know, just values that my parents taught me from when I was a kid.

R:Mostly just gut feeling. Feels wrong, I don’t do it.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to figure that out?
R:Uh, I find it pretty easy.
I:And has it changed in any way over the last couple of years? Has it gotten easier or harder?
R:Uh…I’d say it’s a lot more fuzzy. Just.. a little more hard to determine what’s right or what’s wrong.
I:Ok. Now what do you think it might be that makes something right of wrong? Why is something wrong?
R:Uh…well I think that one goes back to religion. I think a lot of … what we think is right or wrong is based in how you were raised and what kind of religion you grew up in.
I:Is it just because the religion gives you these rules and that’s what determines it?
R:I would say so. I think the Ten Commandments has a lot to do with it. Just the Bible.
I:Ok. Where have you gotten your own moral views from?
R:Well, everything I read and watch on tv and… that kind of stuff. Tend to pick up a little bit from everything.
I:And have they changed in any way, your ideas of right and wrong, over the last 3 years?
R:Uh, I’d say they’ve gotten…a little bit looser. I don’t worry about stuff quite as much.
I:Any examples of what kind of things?
R:Uh, just…like drugs and…underage drinking and that kinda stuff. Just…doesn’t tend to bother me that much anymore.
I:How come?
R:Uh…callous I suppose. Seen too many people doin ‘em.
I:Ok. So your morals you say come from reading and watching TV and…
R:Right.
I:And also your religion you say? So it’s a combination of these things?
R:Pretty much.
I:Are they ever in conflict with each other? Like does your religion tell you something and then a book you read tells you something different?
R:Uh, not typically. Generally they match up pretty well. Especially ‘cause…from my religion,  and that kinda stuff.
I:And you find that it’s commonsensical almost?
R:Pretty much.
I:What about when…like do you have friends who disagree with you on your morals?
R:Uh…sometimes. Friends…most of my friends tend to be…a little less morally obstinate  than me. They’ll take the sleazy way and…worry about the consequences later.
I:Ok. But you think that’s wrong? You don’t agree with that?
R:I don’t like doing that. I don’t…. I don’t like having consequences catch up with me.
I:Ok. Have you had examples of when that’s happened to you or?
R:Uh, not really. Keep myself out of those situations usually.
I:Ok. Because some people might say, well, ‘you’ve got your morals and they’ve got their morals; why are they wrong?’ something like that. How would you respond to that?
R:Uh…
I:Like have you ever tried to persuade a friend that what they think is right is really not right?

I think a lot of … what we think is right or wrong is based in how you were raised and what kind of religion you grew up in. I would say so. I think the Ten Commandments has a lot to do with it. Just the Bible.  Well, everything I read and watch on tv and… that kind of stuff. Tend to pick up a little bit from everything. Right. Pretty much. Uh, not typically. Generally they match up pretty well. Especially ‘cause…from my religion,  and that kinda stuff. Pretty much. Uh…sometimes. Friends…most of my friends tend to be…a little less morally obstinate  than me. They’ll take the sleazy way and…worry about the consequences later. I don’t like doing that. I don’t…. I don’t like having consequences catch up with me. Uh, not really. Keep myself out of those situations usually. Uh… Uh, generally I try to leave my friends to what they wanna do. So long as it doesn’t … pull me in, I’m fine with whatever they wanna do.","The respondent primarily relies on gut feelings to determine right from wrong, believes their moral views are influenced by religion and media, and prefers to follow friends' values over parental guidance, while acknowledging the importance of helping others when it doesn't require undue effort."

R:Instinct.
I:Instinct, okay.  Do you feel like it’s gotten easier or harder in the last couple years for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Oh, it’s easier.  In college, they got, in high school people do a whole bunch of different stuff and I’m like nah, I ain’t gonna do it this time, I just, just ya’ll handle it and I just watch or whatever, I ain’t gonna participate.

R:It’s easy.
I:Okay.  What would you say it is that actually makes something right or wrong?
R:It’s right or wrong, like if you have, if you have to have some consequences, like going to jail or being arrested or that’s considered being bad, so like I ain’t trying to break the law or nothing like that.

I:Okay, so consequences.  Anything else.
R:No, that’s all.

I:Okay.  Anything else, like any other place you got your views of right and wrong?

I:Do you feel like most of your friends kind of agree with you about the way things, like would they be, thinking about right and wrong in similar ways?
R:Yeah, like I can always tell them what’s right and wrong, it’s not up to me if they gonna do it or not, you know, I’ll probably like me and my roommate, we probably the oldest around now, they probably look up to us, they see me doing wrong, they might be doing wrong someday, I just tell them they need to mellow out or whatever, and get your head straight so you know you can get up out of here.","Good or bad in life.

R:Um, my parents really, like you know they tell you when you’re young, like you know this is right and this is wrong, so it’s supposed to stick to your head, in your head, like you know and like somebody might tell you when you’re younger, but then it might come up when you’re older, like you know in your head it’s wrong, like it’s been in your head, you know, you hear from like your parents, your aunts, your uncles that’s wrong and it should stick in your head.  Now if you make the decision to do it, that’s your own mistake, you know hopefully nothing bad will come of it.  You’re taking a chance there.
I:What is it fundamentally that you think makes something right or wrong?
R:I think that if it’s like something like with the drinking, if you know you’re drinking and you’re gonna get drunk cause you can’t really control your liquor, you need to like take it back and like you know get with your friends and sober up before you leave anywhere, you know you want to get drunk on your own time in your own house, don’t go out and go bother someone, and like you know you shouldn’t curse, you know what’s right and wrong, it’s-
I:So what I’m hearing you saying maybe is that cause you affect other people, so what if I just want to sit by myself in my room and get hammered or you know, and I’m not gonna drive, I’m not gonna do anything, is that wrong?
R:It’s still wrong.  You shouldn’t be drinking.
I:Okay, so what is it that makes that wrong?
R:Um, it’s the fact that you know drinking, you should know from health class that drinking is bad for your health, but some people just don’t care, like you know they figure you know I hate it when people say do you smoke cause you think it’s cool?  Some people smoke cause they just like smoking, it’s as simple as that, so.
I:So, so, if you had to define supposed you were writing a dictionary, you would say wrong.  Define the word wrong.
R:Wrong is something that does bodily harm and harm to other people and it’s not good for you.
I:Okay, I can live with that.  For wrong, that’s a good definition.  A succinct definition. How do you decide in your life, you’re trying to make a decision, you know from anything you’re like, do you want a hamburger to do you want to cut class, I mean, you know there’s a process that goes through your head.  Take me through that process, and how you say, okay, out put, this is wrong, this is right?
R:With like serious matters, like that might like you know what to do with my future wise, I would have to consult my parents and people, like I like asking people’s opinions of things.
I:Uh-huh. Okay.
R:But like with a hamburger, it’s either you want a hamburger, or, I might be on the line and there’s a decision like hamburger, chicken or hamburger, if I have a hamburger the other day, I’m having chicken the next day, so you know, so some stuff is like you know simple, you know like make up your own mind.  But other things that affect your life, you maybe should consult somebody with.","Um, my parents really, like you know they tell you when you’re young, like you know this is right and this is wrong, so it’s supposed to stick to your head, in your head, like you know and like somebody might tell you when you’re younger, but then it might come up when you’re older, like you know in your head it’s wrong, like it’s been in your head, you know, you hear from like your parents, your aunts, your uncles that’s wrong and it should stick in your head.

So how do you normally decide or know what’s good or bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:Sometimes you kinda go on guy feeling.  Like, sometimes, I have, like, a really bad feeling about certain things, so I’m like, “I’m not gonna go through with that.”  And other times, I do ask for advice from a parent, friend.
I:Um hm.  So in general, would you say that it’s easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:No, right and wrong is not a problem.  It’s in between issues – the gray area – that I get advice on.  The right – usually, I’m pretty good with, “This is right, and this is wrong.”  And if I feel like – if I’m undecided, that means it’s wrong.  Like, some things should be clearly right and wrong.  Now, if I’m undecided about it, maybe because it’s wrong.
I:So do you think that deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder?  Like, are there more or less gray area things for you?
R:I feel like when you’re younger, it’s less gray areas.  Like, it’s either right or wrong.
I:So in the last couple of years?
R:I think there’s more gray areas – more gray.
I:Can you think of any reason why?
R:I feel like because as you grow, you kind of – you’re supposed to, like, build into your own person and, like, know who you are.  And so I’m thinking I’m still developing that.  So a lot of times, I’m like, “I’m not sure if I should.”  Yeah.  “I’m not sure what to do in this situation.”
I:Ok.  So would you say your views on anything dealing with right and wrong has changed over the last few years?
R:My view on things being right and wrong?  I wouldn’t say – it probably has because if you – I guess it depends on the situation that you’re in.  And therefore, I may view it differently.  And you have people who view things differently in certain situations and other situations.
I:No, like, particular –
R:Not everything you view is coming out –
I:So let’s see.  What do you think it is that, like, makes something right or wrong?
R:I think just your basic knowledge on what you think is right and wrong.
I:Like, is it, like, a feeling?  Or is it a belief?
R:Yeah.  A belief – sometimes it’s a belief or your moral values or – makes things right and wrong.
I:So where do you think most – like, where these kind of beliefs about right and wrong come from usually?
R:For me, probably my parents.  Like, influences in my life – past experiences.
I:Ok.  What about – let’s see.  What do you think about right and wrong generally?  Not just for you, but like, in kind of an abstract way?  Like, what makes something right or wrong, do you think?
R:I feel like – things that makes things right or wrong.
I:It’s kind of a hard question, so take your time.
R:I think what makes things right and wrong – kinda like, if you have – if you’re gonna have doubts about doing something afterwards, then you know it’s right or wrong.  Like me, I – like, my conscience is real guilty sometimes.  So, like, if I know – if I do something whole-heartedly, and I don’t feel bad afterwards, then I know I did the right thing.  If I feel like – I have issues afterwards, I know it was the wrong thing to do.
I:Ok.  So like, where do you feel like those, like, feelings about right and wrong come from?  Anywhere in particular?  Or any source?
R:I don’t know.  Probably like our adrenaline.  Like, I get, like, real – my stomach starts hurting.  My heart starts beating.  And all physiological things start happening.  So that’s where I get it from mostly.
I:So thinking about right and wrong generally, not just for you – who or what do you think has kind of the authority to decide, like, what’s right and wrong?  Who would you, like, trust to decide what’s right and wrong for you or what?  Anything in particular?  Or is it really more like a feeling?
R:I think a lot of it is more of a feeling.  I would say more of a feeling is a thing to go on, as well as – it could also be whether or not it’s – I – to me sometimes, also, like, just going back into, like, my childhood and, like, knowing what my parents have said – that also – I could go on based on whether that was right or wrong.  Although my parents should not be the ultimate decider, they probably still are.
I:Ok.  So where would you say your ideas about what’s right and wrong have come from?
R:I would say mostly, like, young influences.  And also going back to that gut feeling and – just in terms of, like, following rules and things like that – probably whatever has been set forth, like, whether or not it be governmental laws – but just knowing what’s right and wrong because you will get penalized for that.

R:A lot of times they tell you what is wrong and what is right in church so that is what I use.
I:Ok, and in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy.
I:You feel like it is not a hard thing?
R:No.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:You know, it has been pretty much the same.  Steady.
I:You feel like it hasn’t changed at all, or?
R:Maybe a bit easier.
I:Ok.  It’s gotten easier to decide?
R:Yeah.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Just church, I mean, like I said you know if in church it is wrong…
I:So is it rules or laws?
R:Oh, laws as well; yes, society laws.
I:Ok, so and religion
R:Yes.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:My mom and step dad.
I:Have your views about right and wrong changed over the past few years, or stayed the same?
R:They’ve stayed the same.
I:So you haven’t really had any big differences?
R:No.","By religion. A lot of times they tell you what is wrong and what is right in church so that is what I use. It’s easy. No. You know, it has been pretty much the same.  Steady.

R:Yeah, that how I be, you know what I’m saying?  If you hurt somebody, that would be wrong.
I:What about, like, other people might say that if it makes them happy, then it’s right.  Would you agree with that?
R:Yeah. From my momma.

I:Sure.
R:Cause I just don’t know how to answer that one.
I:Well, let’s somebody, um, let’s talk specifically.  Let’s not talk abstractly.  If somebody, um, stole, if one of your friends went in and stole something, is that wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:What make, why?
R:Because you’re supposed to pay for it.  You’re not supposed to steal it, it’s not yours.
I:And if your friend says I don’t agree with that.  Are they wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Is it wrong because they’ve broken the law or is it wrong because besides the law it’s wrong?
R:Uh, both I guess.  They know it’s wrong but they’re going to do it anyways.  Even if they don’t want to spend the extra money for something I guess.
I:Is it wrong because it hurts somebody or is that not really the issue?
R:Yeah, that’s not really the issue.
I:Is it wrong because it hurts the person that’s stealing or is that not the issue?
R:That’s not the issue.  I think it’s wrong well because you’re not supposed to be stealing stuff, you’re supposed to be paying for that stuff.
I:How do we know that, how do we know what we’re supposed to do and what we’re not supposed to do?
R:(pause)
I:I mean the law tells us, here’s what you can’t.
R:Yeah.
I:But is morality just whatever the law says?
R:(pause)
I:Again, you can skip, you can skip out of this if you want to, I don’t want to push you too hard.
R:Yeah, I’ll skip that one.  I know the answer I just don’t’ know how to say it right.
I:Well some people would say, well morality comes from God, I mean the Bible teaches right from wrong and that’s the basis for it. Would you agree with that?
R:Yeah.
I:Do you think that applies for people that don’t even believe in God?
R:What do you mean applies?  That they could follow it?
I:It’s right or wrong for them even if they don’t believe the basis of it.
R:Yeah, like if they were mad at somebody and never forgave, that was wrong.  So.
I:So you have a pretty good sense of right and wrong it seems.
R:Yeah.
I:Where do you think that came from in your own life?
R:My parents.  They taught me well.
I:Your parents taught you.
R:Yeah.
I:Besides them anything?
R:Uh, church I guess.  School.
I:They teach moral, right and wrong at school?

R:From religion.  I would say that, I’m a sinner like everybody else, but you always try to you know, as I hate to say this just because it’s got so annoying, but WWJD? Saying.  Seriously you look at it sometimes and… or just or an analogy I like to use or just something to think about like, “What you do around your friends and what if God was one of them?  Would you say in front of Him?”  So I would say a large part definitely.
I:Did you wear a WWJD? Bracelet?
R:No, I never bought into that fad.
I:In general is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I’d say both.  Sometimes there’s just clear cut things where, I won’t name examples, but I just know, “No, I’m not going to do this.  This is just isn’t who I am,” but sometimes as far that stupid pool hopping thing or something, it’s hard because part of me doesn’t want to let my friends down, but also part of me doesn’t want to just do something outside of character or also, just to do it to like prove myself to my friends because I feel like I have nothing to prove.  If they don’t like me, they would have left me ten years ago because I’ve known them forever.
I:Can you give us some examples of some of the easy things too?
R:Like, not that I’ve been offered, but stuff like, “Wanna smoke a cigarette?” or something like that.  “Wanna do any kind of drugs?”  “No because they ruin your life,” and I’ve talked to, I know some people that have, well one guy that I work with actually I was friends with him in my elementary years, my 4, 5, and 6th grade years and he lived in my neighborhood.  He… I didn’t talk to him for a while, but I met him at work again and I was surprised to see him there because a couple months ago he was driving drunk and a guy ran into the middle of the street who was also drunk and he hit the guy and killed him so he’s awaiting jail time probably from what he’s told me and alcoholism as well as, he told me he got expelled from high school because he did it, not expelled, but suspended the last two weeks of his senior year, didn’t get to walk the graduation because he was busted for smoking pot so I know, I won’t say from like I’ve seen people doing drugs or stuff like that, but that’s just an easy thing for me.  It’s just stupid.  Why would you want to mess up your brain like that?  That’s another type of person you wanna stay away with:  drug addicts or alcoholics or people addicted to cigarettes, or something like that.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Oh definitely harder, definitely.  Just because more opportunities arise to do things for me outside of my nature and I’ll just say, it’s definitely been harder.  And that’s expected I guess because you figure as you grow older more opportunities are presented to you and you need to make decisions as far my claim of I’m 18, I’m trying to be independent, well that’s true.
I:Have your views on what’s right and wrong changed in the past two years?
R:No.  They’ve always remained.  Maybe I would they’ve changed a little bit because, I don’t know how to say this, at times they’ve changed a little big like, “Well this seems kind of stupid so I’ll do this” and then I’ll rethink it and I’m like, “Wow, what was I thinking?”  Maybe it’s changed a little, but it always goes back to where it always was.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:A:  if it’s against the law.  There are set rules in place and we’re all old enough to know that we’re not allowed to do drugs.  We’re not allowed to drink if you’re under 21 or something like that.  So definitely the law comes first and then B, would say:  parents as far as if they would be alright with it because some of us and I’ve fallen guilty to this as well, simple example would be the pool hopping example that we want to kind of start making our own decisions and they’re idea of fun, our parents’ idea of fun, isn’t the same degree as our level of fun now in this day and age.  That’s A and  B I guess, the law and then the parents, as far as the parents, “Oh no, you can’t do that.”
I:So in addition to the Bible, from where to you acquire your moral views?
R:I would say my parents.  Through the Bible I guess, they’ve formed their own, not their own, but theories that they want to embed in me and want me to follow, and parents and certainly church, I feel like I’m repeating myself like crazy, but certainly church as well.  To a degree my school, not as large as a degree as my church definitely just because it’s not as set Christian culture as the church is because the school it’s largely Christian, but there’s definitely a mix of like, you can tell that some kids definitely aren’t where you are.","From religion.

R:Well yeah.
I:I won’t assume anything.  How do you know that?  How do you know which is which?
R:I don’t know.  Probably it’s just something inside of me.
I:Were you taught?  Did your mom raise you morally, teach you this is wrong, this is right, and here’s why, or you just picked it up along the way.
R:I think I just picked it up along the way more than anything.
I:In general, how easy or hard for you to decide right or wrong in your life?
R:Pretty easy.
I:So, what are examples of things that are wrong in your view?
R:It’s wrong to rob people or damage property or just be mean to people in general.
I:What is it that makes things right or wrong?  You think that certain things are right and wrong.  You know what they are.  What makes something wrong or right?
R:I guess it’s all in my head.  Whatever I happen to justify, it makes it right or wrong, I suppose.
I:If it’s wrong, earlier you said it would be wrong to just hurt people.  Why?
R:Why would it be right to hurt people?
I:Some people enjoy it.
R:I’m not just one of those people.
I:Some people benefit by the expense of others.  Stealing, or…
R:I’m not one of those people.  I’m too sensitive and nice of a person.
I:So you said that it’s just in your head, but what if somebody else you meet says, well, I have different things in my head.  Would you say they’re equally right?  Is morality objectively true, regardless of what we think, or is it just whatever we think?
R:No, I would probably think in my head that they were wrong, but I wouldn’t voice my opinion because I’m not anyone to be able to judge anyone.  I don’t really have an say…
I:Why shouldn’t anybody judge anybody?
R:I don’t know, because I just don’t think that’s right.  I don’t think it’s anyone’s place to judge anyone else.
I:Somebody’s acting like a, if somebody’s hurting somebody.
R:Well, then yeah, maybe.
I:You say, hey, that’s wrong.  Stop it.

I:--not really which?
R:it’s not really hard. I mean, like I said, I think things are pretty well defined so…I don’t know.

I:is it the law?
R:law, yeah, has a lot to do with it, society’s rules, I don’t know—
I:--are there things that are legally wrong, no, legally okay, but are still wrong?
R:um, legally okay but still wrong? I’m sure there are some but not that I could personally name right now and say, I don’t know, I don’t think so.
I:one example would be, let’s say your dad cheated on your mother. There’s no law he’s breaking, is it wrong?
R:yeah. Um, uh…yeah. I mean, I guess cons—
I:--is it only wrong because your mother would be upset?
R:I guess. I mean I guess it’s wrong because it’s going to hurt not just my mom but the entire family.
I:what if nobody was upset? Oh dad, you know, would it be alright then?
R:I guess it’s alright if nobody’s hurt, but I don’t know, I don’t see it ever being that way. I guess it’s okay if no one’s hurt.
I:here’s another example. What if your mother, not to belabor this point, but I’m trying to figure this out. What if your mother and father said, jointly, let’s both cheat on each other, mutually agreed. Is that fine? Some people do that actually.
R:I don’t, I mean I think it’s still going to, I think it’s not good for the kids—
I:--what if the kids don’t know?
R:uh, I don’t know, even if they didn’t know I think it’s still going to have effects on the relationship with everybody at home. It’s going to be more or less evident, it’s gonna have, like you said, consequences that wouldn’t have happened. I don’t know if it’s, I don’t know, I mean I still think, I guess it’s wrong.
I:what about your neighbors? The ones that don’t have kids? Is it okay for them?
R:I guess. I mean, part of me wants to say no, that there’s a moral code that we’re supposed to follow, but if nobody’s hurt in the process and it’s a mutual decision and there’s no real consequences, then I guess it’s not necessarily wrong.
I:is there a moral code?
R:I don’t know. If there is, I wouldn’t know what to say it is. I wouldn’t say it’s the bible or anything like that. It’s just, I think there’s an innate part of humans that know what’s good or wrong or evil.
I:where did you come to think like that?
R:I don’t know, right now, putting the two together. I don’t know, it just…I think you have to,  you have a certain responsibility to other people to not only take care of yourself but do what you can for them and for society as a whole, so I think not, I think it goes beyond just what you want for yourself. Which I think—
I:--where does this responsibility come from?
R:I don’t know what decides it. Or where it comes from, I think it’s just, I think that’s the more or less the idea of society, that everybody agrees to these rules and wants to support each other so they have to all follow them. And I think that as a group they have this responsibility.","I guess a lot of it is, I don’t know. Just, I guess, simply society’s rules decides what’s right and wrong, and I’ve always, you know, what is generally approved of, what would my parents think is okay, what would, what’s not, I don’t know. I mean, somehow I think most things are pretty well defined what’s good and not, so. uh, society. I don’t know. Just…I don’t know, just basic ethics. I don’t know what makes something right or wrong. not really— it’s not really hard. I mean, like I said, I think things are pretty well defined so…I don’t know.  I guess so, I mean I guess that’s one of the primary deciding factors I guess. law, yeah, has a lot to do with it, society’s rules, I don’t know— um, legally okay but still wrong? I’m sure there are some but not that I could personally name right now and say, I don’t know, I don’t think so. yeah. Um, uh…yeah. I mean, I guess cons— I guess. I mean I guess it’s wrong because it’s going to hurt not just my mom but the entire family. I guess it’s alright if nobody’s hurt, but I don’t know, I don’t see it ever being that way. I guess it’s okay if no one’s hurt. I don’t, I mean I think it’s still going to, I think it’s not good for the kids— uh, I don’t know, even if they didn’t know I think it’s still going to have effects on the relationship with everybody at home. It’s going to be more or less evident, it’s gonna have, like you said, consequences that wouldn’t have happened. I don’t know if it’s, I don’t know, I mean I still think, I guess it’s wrong. I guess. I mean, part of me wants to say no, that there’s a moral code that we’re supposed to follow, but if nobody’s hurt in the process and it’s a mutual decision and there’s no real consequences, then I guess it’s not necessarily wrong. I don’t know. If there is, I wouldn’t know what to say it is. I wouldn’t say it’s the bible or anything like that. It’s just, I think there’s an innate part of humans that know what’s good or wrong or evil.  I don’t know, right now, putting the two together. I don’t know, it just…I think you have to,  you have a certain responsibility to other people to not only take care of yourself but do what you can for them and for society as a whole, so I think not, I think it goes beyond just what you want for yourself.

R:I think it’s pretty much a … maybe there’s kind of a inherent ability, to know what’s good or bad. I don’t know if you just base on past experiences or … but it’s rare that you would think you know, am I doing the right thing? Am I doing the wrong thing? Or if there’s confusion let’s say, you know. If I’m doing something good, I usually know that this is the right thing to do, or if I do something wrong, whatever that may be, this probably isn’t … I’m not … it’s rare that I go back and say, “Well, you know what? I though I was doing the right thing at the time” or you know, or I don’t know. That’s not right. Because I mean, there are situations where I thought I was doing the right thing at that time but I thought I was doing a good thing, it turns out to be you know … I think given your situation, I think people, the circumstances you know, what you know at the time, I think you know whether it’s a good or bad thing, or it turned out to be true after you discover more things or after consequences happen. That can be different.
I:So you would say it’s pretty easy to decide between right and wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last couple of years?
R:I don’t know. I can’t say that it’s gotten harder. I can’t really say it’s gotten easier either but they stay the same. If I had to choose between right, or easier or harder I would lean towards easier but I can’t really say why.
I:Have your moral views changed in the past two years, in the past couple of years?
R:Probably.
I:How so?
R:Again, I think I really kind of rediscovered or found, you know, Christianity I guess, in the past two or three years, that’s definitely had a significant impact on. I don’t think it’s made me realize more things are right or wrong. I think it’s just made me aware of, you know, of more. I don’t know. It’s hard to give an example, but you know. I have a moral obligation to help people in need that I may not have recognized before that. But I don’t know. I think I have… my morals may have increased.
I:Now, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Okay, what makes something right or wrong? Again, I think you kind of just, I think … Okay, if something’s right, there’s a … I think for something to be right it can’t hurt someone else. I’m not saying as to help everybody in the situation but if it hurts somebody, maybe it’s not the right thing to do.
I:So are you talking about then the consequences of an action or something else?
R:I guess it’s the consequences. Not necessarily just for the people involved but on a greater scale, the consequences for or the general consequences for everybody. If I help this person, not only how will I help them but what will happen to the people around the person. I think all of that has to be considered.
I:And what kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:Again, I mean anything, and I use the term “loosely” that hurts, whether that would be physical or mental or emotional, that strips somebody in such a way that, or negatively impacts somebody. I think it’s kind of a broader commission, I think it’s important but it’s broad that if anything that hurts somebody, it’s wrong. I don’t know what makes right or wrong.
I:Where have you acquired your moral views from?
R:I don’t know, I think it’s just … I think you kind of, I mean I’m sure they are learned. I’m sure my parents are responsible for a majority of them, I’m sure my faith is responsible for some of them, I can’t … I mean I don’t know, I can’t say if this is where they come from but I think it’s a combination of teaching and experiences that define that.","I think it’s pretty much a … maybe there’s kind of a inherent ability, to know what’s good or bad.

I:Okay, um, and how do you decide usually like what, what makes something right or wrong?
R:I go with what I’ve been taught, growing up and whatnot, or my gut feeling or what, basically what I’m comfortable with, if not, if I’m not comfortable doing it then it’s probably wrong.","Um, like I, like I said, there’s no way to make stealing, cheating or lying right, I mean, doing drugs of any kind, I don’t see as right at all, um, drinking excessively, you know, I don’t agree with a lot of today’s popular sexual habits and stuff, being able and, doing whatever you want and whoever you want and stuff, I don’t agree with a lot of things like that.

R:I go by what I was taught, my grandparents taught me the most I think, cause when, in your teenage years that’s when you’re really exposed to the world, you’re not babied any more, you don’t see the world as playgrounds and classrooms, you get to really see the world.  And they just taught me to stand up for myself and stick to my guns and just don’t let anybody get me down kind of thing.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s not very hard for me at all.  I’ve just always gone by what I’ve been taught through school and through my grandparents, and so far it’s gotten me alright, so I just keep sticking with what I’ve been taught.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Um, it depends on the subject.  When it comes to actually dealing with people it’s hard to determine what’s the right or wrong thing to say, cause you never really know what might offend somebody.  But when it comes to like stealing, drugs, typical crimes, it’s very easy for me to decide what’s right and what’s wrong.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, I think for somebody, beliefs, it’s the way you were raised.  If your parents raised you to have respect for authority, whether it be the police or family, I had a general respect for authority.  I saw the police as my hero’s I didn’t see them as somebody who’s just going to stick me in handcuffs.  Whereas more kids today they just see them as someone they need to run from.  I was always taught that you go to the police if you need help.  And I just think that what’s right and wrong just comes strongly from how you were raised and what your parents teach you.
I:What about actions, what makes an action right or wrong?  Not necessarily for a particular person?
R:Really if it hurts somebody.  I mean, whether you say something wrong and hurt someone’s feelings, or if you physically throw something and it physically hurts somebody or you drive incorrectly and you crash into someone and it hurts them, it always leads to someone getting hurt.
I:So do you think there are things that are wrong that don’t hurt people?
R:Um, I don’t, I don’t, I think there are probably things that you think don’t hurt people and whatnot.  But if you steal, you’re costing that company money, which makes them drop wages, which makes somebody not able to pay their bills. So yeah, there’s some things that don’t appear to hurt people, but physically maybe not, but there’s always some way that’s going to damage somebody’s life.
I:Do you think there are things that might hurt people that are right?
R:Not in particularly.  Unless that person being punished might help somebody.  Like yeah, putting someone in prison hurts that person that’s being put into prison but they did something to be put there.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Um, I believe there are many actions that are always wrong.  Like any kind of abuse.  Drugs, abusing somebody, any kind of abuse no matter what is always wrong.
I:Okay, why do you think that’s wrong?
R:Because if you abuse a drug, you’re only going to hurt yourself, if you abuse verbally or sexually, or uh, physically abuse somebody, you’re going to hurt that person.  So I mean, I don’t know really what else to say.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Um, things I was taught when I was younger.  Maybe some of the things I observed on TV.  My parents were always a big fan of watching America’s Most Wanted, Cops, the more reality shows, not the real fake cartoons where they get away with whatever.  So I was always raised that those things were wrong.  And if I did something that I thought was right and it was wrong, I was always told no, that’s wrong.  So.
I:So you mentioned that most of your ideas of right and wrong were taught to you.  Where do you think those views came from for those people that taught them to you?
R:The ones I, that I learned from my parents, they were probably values that they learned from their parents, and on down the line as generations went along.  A lot of it was taught to me through school, from you know, when they get the kids together in an auditorium and they teach them that kids are bad or drinking’s bad, and that’s probably something, it’s just, they see that a crime is being committed more and more, you know, through the town, so they think they need to let the kids know what they’re doing and why it’s wrong.
I:Why do you trust the history in your family and the people in school to tell you what’s right and wrong?
R:Uh, I was just always taught to respect what my parents said, what my teachers said, what the police officer says, I think it’s a respect issue.  If they’re going to tell you that, I think you should listen to it.","I go by what I was taught, my grandparents taught me the most I think, cause when, in your teenage years that’s when you’re really exposed to the world, you’re not babied any more, you don’t see the world as playgrounds and classrooms, you get to really see the world.

How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I basically go back to what I was taught as a kid.  I mean, I think a lot about what my parents - what would my parents think a lot.  And sometimes, I do that too much, and a lot of times, I’ll be like, “Well, what would Toby* think if I did this,” too because I mean, he’s the person I live with and I share my life with.  If he’s not gonna be happy with it because it’s something - a wrong - possibly a wrong decision, then that’s the consequence I’ll have to deal with everyday.
I:Right.  Yeah.  In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Normally, it’s pretty easy.  I feel I have a pretty good judgment, and I don’t normally - really don’t have to put myself in that situation very often to actually contemplate what’s right or wrong.  I normally know, “Ok.  Not going there,” if I’m gonna do something.
I:Yeah.  Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Probably a lot easier because as you grow up, you get more experiences and you learn a lot more about how people react to the things that you do.
I:Um hm.  Would you say your views about what is right and wrong have changed in the past two years?
R:Not, like, ethically - like, as far as the easier stuff to talk about like drinking and alcohol - stuff like doing drugs - stuff like that.  I - they haven’t changed.  I’ve always felt the same way about those.  But I’ve had - I’ve changed jobs a few times, you know whether or not to give a notice, how to treat those in management positions, how to and how not to treat people underneath you, how close to get to them as friends and still keep that professional environment - stuff like that, I’ve had to deal with, but it’s - I definitely learned a lot.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:That’s a hard question to actually put into words.
I:Yeah, I know.
R:Just basically the way it affects people and the people around you.  You have to think about that and the way it’s gonna affect yourself.
I:So it’s, like, certain types of consequences make something wrong?
R:Yeah.  Like, if you do drugs, not just are you looking at, like, jail - possible jail time and things like that, but you’re actually gonna be doing nothing by hurting your body.  Like, you’re gonna have to deal with it later.  So it’s like, “Ok.  Well, there’s a reason you’re not supposed to do that because not only are you gonna go to jail, but you’re gonna cause brain damage, or you’re gonna cause damage to your mouth or whatever,” depending on what drugs you’re talking about and stuff like that.  And then the same thing with alcohol.  Not only can you lose control of yourself and your thinking and have dramatic consequences that night, but if you keep doing it, you could eventually end up losing a liver at 40 years old or something like that.  So you definitely set your limits and know when it’s time to stop and know when it’s time to not do something at all by what you’re gonna be facing in the future.
I:Right.  Ok.  Do you think it’s wrong when people do things that just hurt themselves?  Or does it have to have, like, adverse consequences on those around them?
R:I think no matter what, if you hurt yourself, it’s still gonna have consequences with people around you.  I think people that think they can do things to themselves, “Oh, it only hurts me.”  But they’re very selfish, and they don’t realize that hurting yourself does hurt people around you, as well.
I:Ok.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  From where would you say you’ve acquired your moral views?
R:A lot of them have been from my parents and my grandparents.  And also just from the basic influence of people I’ve kept around me, watching - I had cousins and things like that that did a lot more, got into - they could have gotten into a lot more trouble if their parents knew more about what was going on, and I watched what they did and how they would stress out over whether or not their parents knew and stuff like that.  So I kinda - I watched - I paid a lot of attention to the people around me, and also took - I also took heed a lot to what people were telling me.","I basically go back to what I was taught as a kid.

If he’s not gonna be happy with it because it’s something - a wrong - possibly a wrong decision, then that’s the consequence I’ll have to deal with everyday. Normally, it’s pretty easy.  I feel I have a pretty good judgment, and I don’t normally - really don’t have to put myself in that situation very often to actually contemplate what’s right or wrong.  I normally know, “Ok.  Not going there,” if I’m gonna do something. Probably a lot easier because as you grow up, you get more experiences and you learn a lot more about how people react to the things that you do. Not, like, ethically - like, as far as the easier stuff to talk about like drinking and alcohol - stuff like doing drugs - stuff like that.  I - they haven’t changed.  I’ve always felt the same way about those.  But I’ve had - I’ve changed jobs a few times, you know whether or not to give a notice, how to treat those in management positions, how to and how not to treat people underneath you, how close to get to them as friends and still keep that professional environment - stuff like that, I’ve had to deal with, but it’s - I definitely learned a lot.  That’s a hard question to actually put into words. Just basically the way it affects people and the people around you.  You have to think about that and the way it’s gonna affect yourself. Yeah.  Like, if you do drugs, not just are you looking at, like, jail - possible jail time and things like that, but you’re actually gonna be doing nothing by hurting your body.  Like, you’re gonna have to deal with it later.  So it’s like, “Ok.  Well, there’s a reason you’re not supposed to do that because not only are you gonna go to jail, but you’re gonna cause brain damage, or you’re gonna cause damage to your mouth or whatever,” depending on what drugs you’re talking about and stuff like that.  And then the same thing with alcohol.  Not only can you lose control of yourself and your thinking and have dramatic consequences that night, but if you keep doing it, you could eventually end up losing a liver at 40 years old or something like that.  So you definitely set your limits and know when it’s time to stop and know when it’s time to not do something at all by what you’re gonna be facing in the future. I think no matter what, if you hurt yourself, it’s still gonna have consequences with people around you.  I think people that think they can do things to themselves, “Oh, it only hurts me.”  But they’re very selfish, and they don’t realize that hurting yourself does hurt people around you, as well.  A lot of them have been from my parents and my grandparents.  And also just from the basic influence of people I’ve kept around me, watching - I had cousins and things like that that did a lot more, got into - they could have gotten into a lot more trouble if their parents knew more about what was going on, and I watched what they did and how they would stress out over whether or not their parents knew and stuff like that.  So I kinda - I watched - I paid a lot of attention to the people around me, and also took - I also took heed a lot to what people were telling me.","The respondent plans to use an inheritance of $100,000 to pay off debts, pursue education, and potentially donate to animal shelters, while their decision-making is heavily influenced by their upbringing, the opinions of their partner, and a belief in the consequences of their actions, emphasizing the importance of considering how choices affect both themselves and others."

R:My parents, um, my church, a little from school and society in general. Things like drug and alco—drugs and alcohol are really being looked down on in society a lot more now, I think, or at least in schools they’re like, that’s bad, you know.  So.
I:Mm-mm.  Yeah.  And um, is there something, what, what can you think, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  What, what kind of determines whether it’s right or wrong?  Is there some fundamental?
R:
I:Ah, yeah, something fundamental that, a fundamental principle that sort of helps us know, you know what is right or wrong.  What, what is the foundation for right and wrong. Whether it helps.  You know if it, if it’s right then it’ll have something good that it does.  If it’s wrong, it’ll have a negative.  It’s really that simple. So how do you decide or how do you know what is good and bad, right or wrong in life?  I mean, when you’re faced with these decisions, what do you do, how do you know, how do you think about it?
R:I use my best judgment, ___________________ .  So.
I:Any examples of that, where you had a difficult situation, um, figuring out what’s right and wrong to do?  And how did you, how did you get it sorted out?
R:I don’t know.  There’s things like um, I don’t, I broke up with my girlfriend like a week ago, just cause ah, it was getting a little too close you know.  She wanted more, and I was just like, yeah, I’m not gonna have sex with you.  And I broke up with her and she didn’t understand at all, but you know, I knew that was for me the right thing to do.  That was my, the right decision for me, it’s just,  I’m not gonna get involved in that, and ah.
I:So she, she was ready to get very close, very emotionally connected, um, and for her it made sense that if you’re emotionally connected you’re ah, also involved in sex and that kind of thing.
R:Yeah.
I:And you felt that that wasn’t, you felt that that wasn’t right.
R:Yeah.
I:And kind of, what, what was the basis for knowing that, was that something that you got, that you knew was something that, because of your religion, or because of your family or because of the consequences or what you hope to do or be sometime?
R:Um, religion, is part of it.  And then just the consequences that I know can follow.  I have a good imagination for what could go wrong in that sort of situation, and so, it’s a little of each, I think.  It’s mainly just religion, like that’s something I said I would never do before marriage.  So then all __________ .
I:And something that’s taught at your church?
R:Yeah.
I:Does your church talk about that quite a bit, like pressures facing teenagers and what to do about it?
R:They do.

R:They do, um, a good amount and.","My parents, um, my church, a little from school and society in general.

R:Well, I mean, my religion plays a huge part in that. And so, like specific things, a lot of things are just pretty clearly black and white. That, especially within my church, like “this is a yes or no, this not a grey area”. And then for things that are kind of, that fall into the grey area, the one thing that I usually do if I’m, if it’s something important. Like if it’s not terribly critical and I don’t think it’ll have a big effect I’ll just choose one way or the other. If it’s something I think will have an effect for a while, I’ll usually try and find time to pray about it and ask God.
I:So generally you feel like it’s sort of easy or hard to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:Generally, I think it’s pretty simple. Like if it’s something that I personally can’t seem to decide, usually praying about it, I’ll be able to get a pretty clear answer one way or the other.
I:In the last two or three years, do you think it’s gotten easier or harder to decide?
R:I think it’s gotten easier. And part of that is I’m used to asking now, and used to receiving answers, and it makes it a bit easier. But also I think I know better who I am, so that helps me to be more clear-cut about what I do and do not do and why, like personal decisions.
I:So you mentioned praying about it and the, like do you feel like you always get an answer about that?
R:Not always. And occasionally it’s not the answer I want. It happens. And sometimes I don’t get an answer right away, or it’ll take a day or two. Or I’ll just get an answer like “it doesn’t matter.” I’ve had that happen, where I just get a distinct feeling that it’s like, it’s really not that important. Just “do what you want” sort of thing. And so, like, you know it varies depending on my needs.
I:Can you talk about what that’s like? Feel a sense or, I’m not sure what the language you would use to get an answer.
R:Well it’s, it’s one of those things that seems to be pretty individual to the person. You know, some people say that they feel more than they hear a voice or anything like that. Personally, when I pray about a question, usually I, it’s kind of hard to express. It’s not like I hear a voice out loud, but kind of in my thoughts, I generally will feel or “hear” sort of, you know, an answer or response. And it’s kind of that same voice that a lot of people call their conscience, which is referred to in my religion as “the Holy Ghost”. And generally when I pray and ask about a question, sometimes it is something really powerful. But generally it will come as more of a feeling or, it’s a, the call it a “burning in the bosom”, kind of like a really warm feeling in your chest. But with other more delicate questions, often I more like hear a voice in my thoughts that tells me what to do or not.
I:In the last couple of years do you feel like knowing right or wrong has gotten easier or harder?
R:Didn’t you ask that?
I:What would you say it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Generally speaking, it, I would say that there’re a couple of things that factor into it. Number one is God’s opinion on the subject. You know, if He says something is wrong, then it’s wrong and there’s no denying or arguing with that. And that’s just based on the fact that, well He knows a lot more than we do, and so we just need to trust Him. And then the other part of that is, I think, a little easier for people to see, is the effect that it has on people, participated or affected by it. You know, does this thing make you feel good? Does it make you happy? Or does it just make a situation worse? So that’s, yeah.
I:So you mentioned religion as one source of your moral views. Any other sources for your ideas on morality?
R:I imagine my environment’s played a pretty big role in it. I mean that’s kind of hard to see, having, having lived there. But I would say that, yeah my parents, my family, my church, of course, and the people in it have all played a role as well as the people, like teachers in my school and friends I had, and stuff like that.","Well, I mean, my religion plays a huge part in that.

R:Um, definitely, well God’s word, but then also if you take it from like the world’s stance, like the bible does line up, like the things that people do that would be considered wrong, the consequences, there are always consequences, and they’re damaging, and that clearly makes it not a good decision, so.
I:So does the consequences make something wrong, or do you think the things that are wrong just have natural consequences?
R:Yeah.  I guess, things that are wrong just have natural consequences.
I:Okay so that if, just for instance, if you thought you could do something and not get caught, would that make it okay?
R:No.  I mean things are, right and wrong doesn’t change, and like that, yeah, I do establish from the bible.  But you can, I mean I can see that stealing is against the law, and there are repercussions and it’s harming someone else.  So that’s a pretty good tip off that it’s not a good idea.
I:Okay.  Okay.  But you would say that the bible and God’s word is what comes first in your criteria list?
R:Yeah.  Yeah.
I:Okay.  Um, and do you believe there are things that are always wrong in themselves, as opposed to situation?

I:Okay what kind of things are always wrong?
R:Murder, or well, even when I say that there’s like the self defense clause.
I:Right.

I:No, that’s a separate question.
R:So, yeah, so I’d say the Bible then, with that.
I:And in general, do you think it’s easy for you, personally, to decide between right and wrong?
R:It really depends on what it is.  I'm pretty indecisive, if it’s clear-cut, then yes, but life has a lot of sticky situations, and those, no.
I:When you’re not sure in a situation like that, what do you usually do?
R:I typically call my friend, Jackie* .
I:Okay, that’s good.
R:Or talk to other people.
I:Just to get their perspective?
R:Yeah, to find out.  Because typically it’s the kind of thing like there might not be a clear right or wrong so I mean, what’s the best course of action?  So I like other’s opinions.
I:Do you feel like deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:It’s definitely gotten harder.
I:Any reason why?
R:Oh, just learning to tolerate more gray.

Where do your own views of right and wrong come from?

I:How from church?
R:Well just by like what’s in the Bible and stuff, you know I don’t really believe the Bible word for word, cause that’s, that’s how my parents have raised me that the Bible is not word for word, it’s meant to be interpreted, so just like with, there’s some stuff—
I:What does that mean?  Word for word?
R:Like, like where it says the earth was created in seven days, that’s, I mean like, scientists prove that’s not true, so.  Me and my Dad talk about that, actually, somewhat frequently about Bible and like what it means and like—
I:Do you?  Tell me about those conversations.
R:Well we just usually, ah, I don’t know, I usually bring it up.  And we just talk about it, he just, we just talk about like views from other religions and stuff, too.  And then we just talk about our view, too, we don’t like say, oh that religion’s wrong, we just say what we believe and we compare to other religions somewhat.  And like he talks about what he believes is how like it’s supposed to be interpreted and you find out, and like he reads and like doesn’t believe it word for word but he like, what the real meaning is supposed to be.  That’s what, that’s how he looks at it, and he’s kind of put that into me.
I:What do you think of that?
R:I think, I think he’s right.  I think there’s some stuff in the Bible that scientists prove is not true, but you’re just meant to interpret it.
I:Like what?
R:Like well as I said before, the earth created in seven days, Adam and Eve, I don’t believe in that.  And like that, it just appeared and just, there’s other things, I’m not—
I:How did it happen?
R:I’ve never read the Bible.  I don’t know, I’m—
I:What do you mean you’ve never read the Bible?
R:I’ve never like read the entire Bible, word for word, like I’ve listened to passages in church and stuff like that.  And like oh, how do I think that like the earth came, then?  I’m not exactly sure, I’m, I guess the one that makes most sense to me is the big bang theory, that’s my, that’s what I think, I guess, is right.  And then evolution, I don’t—
I:So what does your church say, do you know?
R:I’m not exactly sure what my church says about, I don’t, I know that they say the Bible is meant to be interpreted, not word for word, I know that’s what it is, but I’m not really sure what they believe about, we’ve talked about it in Sunday School before like and we shared our own views about how the earth was created.  And people just had different opinions about it, but I’ve never, I don’t really know what—
I:So are that, is everybody right or is, is there one correct?
R:I’m not, I’m not sure, though, I just think what I believe, but that could be wrong, so.  I’m not sure.
I:So you bring up these conversations most of the time?
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Why?  Do you think that you do?
R:Um, just on my mind, and me and my Dad are driving to a hockey game or something like that, I just talk to him about it.
I:What kind of questions would you ask?
R:Like I don’t really talk to my Mom about that stuff, I talk to my Dad about that.
I:Why?
R:I don’t know.  It’s just on my mind, I just wonder, I’ve always asked a ton of questions, my Dad said that’s just always how I was, I’d ask a million questions a day.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t really know how to describe that, I mean, like I’ve just thought things, some things are right and some things are wrong, I just, I don’t really know how to describe it.
I:That’s okay.  How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong?
R:I think about what my parents have told me, what’s right and wrong, like what I believe is right and wrong from like what I’ve learned and then I think about what the consequences will be if I do it or not.

How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:uh, that’s a tough question. I would say intuition, but I think it’s a lot more than that. I think a lot of it has to do with the way I’m raised, the way I was raised by my parents  as much as I’d like to think I’m different from my parents, I wouldn’t even like to think that.  I know that I’m really similar to my parents and that it’s always, I think I go on a lot of what my parents raised me, what was right and wrong and treating other people with respect and all those sorts of things.  Basically being a kind person and I think my parents beat that into me pretty well and I think I would feel weird doing otherwise.  I think I draw a lot on my upbringing and I would say I still draw a lot on my experience with this religious group of friends and I would still consider myself more of a secular Christian and at least in terms of social justice, following Christian teachings, like putting others before yourself, I think that’s still something that’s pretty important to me even if I might not believe the religious part of it, I still believe in the secular part of doing good and leaving the world a better place than you found it.
I:ok.  has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder in the past couple years?
R:I wouldn’t say it’s gotten harder, I would say it’s something I spent time examining and just become a little more, become more difficult, there were some things that I did before I became a Christian for these two years which I then thought were wrong and now I think were right. So I still spend a lot of time, I’m still trying to figure out what my moral code is, but I would still say except for a little I basically follow the Christian teaching at least in terms of social justice, it hasn’t been harder it’s just been,  it’s been harder in the sense of figuring it out, but I wouldn’t say it’s been difficult, it’s just been complicated.
I:in general is it easy to decide between right and wrong?
R:no I think I generally have a pretty good sense of if something’s going to be slightly off.  I usually judge that by asking is this harming anyone else or harming myself in a way that I really know I shouldn’t be doing it.
I:what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I would say like I said before, if it harms another person or night, whether that be not only physically, but emotionally or spiritually.  Anything that causes another person distress or whatever or makes them seem uncomfortable.  Then it gets difficult and you get into situations where it hurts more than one person and who do you think is right, but I think generally it’s whether or not it’s if you’re gonna do this it’s gonna hurt somebody.  And of course you can get into philosophical arguments about whether you know you’re hurting other people and when it’s okay, but I think as a general guideline that usually what I rely on.
I:ok, from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:I would say a lot of my parents and just outside reading too like reading the Bible and once I touched a philosophy class the beginning of junior year in high school that time got me hooked on it and really interesting subjects, so just books I’ve read and my friends all make fun of me because I read textbooks for fun, so but it’s something I enjoy so I would say outside reading and my upbringing really.","uh, that’s a tough question.

I:Uh-huh.  What is it at a fundamental level that makes something right or wrong?  Is it taking something away from somebody else or is it hurting somebody, or is there something else that’s going on do you think?
R:I think that if something hurts you or somebody else, it’s wrong.  You can’t hurt somebody.
I:And that’s because…
R:Um, there would not be a point to it not being wrong if, it didn’t hurt somebody.  That’s why you’re not allowed to do things.
I:Okay.  And can you give me a recent example in your life where you’ve had to make a decision about something that was right or wrong.  Either like you said before like where you have the chance to think about it beforehand or if you’re in the middle of it and you kind of have to do some sort of moral reasoning to decide what you will or won’t do.
R:Um,
I:Maybe an example of, of how you decided to go conservative, that, that would be good.
R:Okay.
I:(chuckles)

I:Uh-huh.

I:Even something little like at home or school or like that where you know that it would probably be wrong if you went one way or that you decided to go another way.  Or that you go ahead and,
R:Well like the girls, the girls in my class have some serious boy problems. We’re going home from a varsity football game.  They sit one person to every seat.  So that the boys have to sit next to a girl!  So I sat next to a girl.
I:Okay, so to keep away from kind of the boy problem issues?
R:Yeah.","Um, Because that’s what our society is based on.  That we have these rights. It’s not in the Declaration of Independence, it’s, um, it got written down on paper for the first time and that was important but it’s um, you know, everybody has these rights and if you take somebody’s away you’re taking it away, you can’t do that. Yeah. It would be a mess.  We would look like Africa.  People would be running through the streets killing each other. Um, reading the bible and listening to my parents and other people talk.

R:Basically I’m very well set in what I believe the Christian world views based on theology are, and so I compare things to that and decide.  And if I can’t figure out something myself, I’ll ask about it.  But I kind of am of the opinion that if you’re asking about it, you're probably asking about it because you know the right answer and you just want to follow through with it.
I:.
R:You want permission to do something else.
I:Hoping somebody gives you permission.
R:Yeah.
I:So you would say it’s generally easy or hard for you know between right and wrong, decide between right and wrong?
R:It's generally easy for me.
I:Because of that grounding you say you have?
R:Yeah.
I:And as deciding,
R:And so I’m also – my personality type, I was most conscientious voted in my class when we graduated, and that’s out of 20 people.  And my best friend came up to me after we wrote everything down, and she’s like, “I can’t tell you what I put, but it’s perfect for you.”  So they were very correct.  I’m a very conscientious person, so.
I:So you're always thinking about doing the right thing, and that’s your intent most of the time?
R:Yeah.  It tends to drive people crazy though too.
I:Would you say that that’s gotten easier or harder for you over the past couple years?  This doing or thinking about right or wrong?
R:Easier.
I:Easier?  Why so?
R:I think I’m more comfortable asserting myself, and being like, “This is what I think, and I’m going to do something else just because the situation, or whatever.”  So I also think in some ways kind of an interesting question.  Like, how many times we actually confronted the choosing to do something right or wrong is like this major issue, as opposed to just like, the sign says, “No parking,” but I’m only going to be here for five minutes, or it’s only a little lie.  You just kind of – I’ve never had to probably in many years now, choose I’m going to do this because it’s right, and this is a huge major decision, so.
I:Now, tell me what it is that you think makes something right or wrong?  What is it about whatever the thing is that’s right or wrong?  Don’t give me big philosophical thing.
R:That’s asking for a big philosophical thing there.  I will, the discourses of power tell us that.
I:I mean, when you really think about that, why is something right or why is something wrong?
R:I mean, I believe there are basically, like, moral principles set forth in the Bible.  And I guess if you don't want a big philosophical answer we better leave it there.
I:That’s okay, but I mean, in some way essentially yet at some level there's a structure of rules and laws and guidelines that say what is or isn’t morally, what’s right and what’s wrong.
R:Yeah, in some ways though, okay, I’m literally thinking about philosophy here.  I mean, you look at arguments of, like, is this morally wrong?  If you change this law, then would it now be morally right?  If God came to you and said, “It’s okay to do this,” but you think it’s wrong morally, you probably think it’s wrong morally not because God’s saying it, but because it’s morally wrong.  Which of course the usual things that we use to kind of like, if God walked up to you and said, “You can rape this person,” it’s still morally wrong.  Just because God said he changed his mind, it’s still morally wrong.  So in some ways there's some kind of transcendent set of morals that are right and you can’t go past them.
I:And you think that those are, that they’re just there, or they’re there because of the consequences?  It’s like, the right or wrongness is because those transcendent rules are out there and you just can’t go past them, or the transcendent rules are out there because maybe there’s consequences that happen that can be bad.  Or do consequences make any difference?  It's like it’s either right or wrong regardless of the consequences?  Because it sounded to me like on your rape example, that the nature of the consequential sort of thing, doesn’t make that sort of required, and you were saying that would be wrong because of that.  Are you, but I don't know if you’re saying that.  I’m just asking.
R:Are you saying that I’m saying that consequences don't matter, or that I’m saying that consequences do?
I:Are they the basis for right or wrong?
R:No.
I:It’s the transcendent rules, or guidelines, or whatever you want to call those.
R:Yeah, kind of like, trying to remember who came up with it, but it’s a question like, if you can do something wrong, but the only reason that you can think of that it's wrong is because it will hurt somebody, and you can guarantee that nobody will ever find out, then is it – well, I know what the argument is.  It’s like, if you cheat on your wife, but she’s never going to find out, then is it more wrong that you cheated on her, or more wrong that you told her that you cheated on her?  Because it only has bad consequences if she finds out, so if you just never tell her, and make sure she never finds out, then it was okay.  Then the question is, was it really wrong for you to cheat on your wife or not?  And I would say, yeah, it was wrong for you to cheat on your wife, even if she’s never actually going to feel any pain from it, so.
I:It’s the principle that’s wrong.
R:Yeah.
I:Its transcendent principles are out there about what is and isn’t ok.  And where would you say your moral views have come from?
R:Reading the Bible, and reading the Apologetics, and taking philosophy classes, and getting A’s in philosophy classes.","Basically I’m very well set in what I believe the Christian world views based on theology are, and so I compare things to that and decide.  And if I can’t figure out something myself, I’ll ask about it.  But I kind of am of the opinion that if you’re asking about it, you're probably asking about it because you know the right answer and you just want to follow through with it. You want permission to do something else. Yeah. It's generally easy for me. Yeah. And so I’m also – my personality type, I was most conscientious voted in my class when we graduated, and that’s out of 20 people.  And my best friend came up to me after we wrote everything down, and she’s like, “I can’t tell you what I put, but it’s perfect for you.”  So they were very correct.  I’m a very conscientious person, so. Yeah.  It tends to drive people crazy though too. Easier. I think I’m more comfortable asserting myself, and being like, “This is what I think, and I’m going to do something else just because the situation, or whatever.”  So I also think in some ways kind of an interesting question.

R:Yeah.
I:What about, it’s not against the law to have sex before marriage, but you think that’s wrong.
R:Yeah the—
I:So what is it that makes that?
R:The Bible.
I:So the Bible teaches what’s right and wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  So how do you personally know what’s good and bad and right and wrong in life, you know, you’re trying to figure out how to live and what choices to make, how do you know what’s right and wrong?
R:You can just, you kinda have a feeling that you know what’s wrong or right.  You can tell.
I:So, inside you have the feeling about it.
R:And you listen to the adults.
I:And adults teach you.
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  Can you give me like an example of something that you have to learn, oh, that’s the thing I should do, that’s the thing I shouldn’t do, that, you either have this inner feeling or adults taught you?

R:If I feel guilty about doing it, I usually won’t do it.
I:You’ll know ahead of time that you would feel guilty?
R:Yeah, I’ll know ahead of time, like for, I would never get in the car and drink.  I wouldn’t ride with anybody because I know that if my mom said that-
I:So you have kind of a guilt meter?
R:Guilt meter kind of thing.  If I knew, for example, if I'm doing something and I know if I get caught it could be prison time-not doing that.  If I did something and they said it was bad, if God was up there just shaking his head looking at me, not doing that either.  Just something I won’t go that far and do.
I:So it’s partly sort social consequences and it’s partly sort of religious?
R:Yeah, I'm still kind of keeping in my religious morals.  I mean I may have strayed a bit, but.
I:So in general, how easy or hard is it for you to figure out right and wrong?
R:It’s pretty easy for me.
I:Has it gotten easier or harder in the last three years?
R:I’d say it’s gotten easier.  Back in high school I guess it’s just a confusing time, you’re hanging out with different people.  First time I drank I was maybe a junior, about to graduate, about to go to summer of junior year and somebody asked me if I wanted to go to a party and I went and I basically the first time you ever open a beer and at that age you kind of feel bad about it but the next day you’re kind of just thinking everybody else does it.  I mean it’s not really that peer-pressure thing, but I’d say there’s a lot, I mean nowadays if I don’t want to drink, I don’t drink and nobody can tell if I want, like if I'm going to.
I:So in high school the main sort of moral issue do I gather is whether to be drinking or not?
R:Yeah whether you’re going to be drinking-
I:What was more confusing back then to you?
R:Whether to be drinking, have sex, whether to do any, basically the typical teenage stuff, drinking, smoking, having sex.  That was probably the most difficult of things because once you hit college, if you’re still a virgin, guys will be like what?  Girls love it because I'm still a virgin to this day, girls love it.  Guys, they’ll kind of look at you like what kind of thing.  But nowadays I don’t care what they think.
I:Why do girls love it?
R:I guess they like the fact that, I guess they’re hoping that they’ll be your first.  Or they just love the fact that you’re not running around with girls, kind of thing.  My girlfriend is a virgin, I'm a virgin, that’s why we usually get along really well.  We’ll talk about it sometimes.
I:What about other possible moral issues in high school, like cheating in school or lying to parents or stealing something, are those issues?  Or not issues?
R:Never been a thief.  Never stolen.  Lying-
I:But I mean in terms of temptation.
R:Temptation, I was never tempted to steal anything.  Sure I was tempted every now and then on a quiz in Spanish, we would, I would sit next to my friend and he’d be like dude, what’s this?  And I’d be like here, I don’t care.  I mean it was just an  we had to take.
I:So what do you think is it that makes, we talked about this a little bit already, but I just want to make sure I understand, what is it that makes something right or wrong?  Where does right and wrong come from?
R:Personally for me right or wrong comes from, I'm not going to say the Puritan Christian values, but like contemporary, I just set my life by the teachings of Christ.
I:So are you saying the Bible or what your church teaches, or?
R:Basically the Bible.  Denominations and church, this sounds bad, but if I followed the church, my church is no drinking, this is going to sound worse, be a Republican, kind of thing.
I:It actually teaches that?
R:My church particularly doesn’t, but that denomination, I went to my girlfriend’s church, she’s an independent Baptist, and it kind of ticked me off because when the preacher got up there he did this little thing about, he talked about Iraq, and he said a lot of people want, all the politicians think we should just pull out but this country was founded by fighting for what we believe in and you have to do this and I was just kind of like what?
I:Oh my, so you’re saying specific churches teach what you think are too restrictive or narrow so you’re taking Christianity and the Bible not a specific church?
R:Yeah, I think of Christianity as basically my interpretation of it, what I know right from wrong, what I read; anything from that.","If I feel guilty about doing it, I usually won’t do it.

R:The bible.
I:The bible?  What is it that you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:You think about if it hurts other people if you want to be done to yourself or not.
I:And why is it wrong to hurt other people?

How do you normally decide or know what is good or bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:I don’t know.  That’s one of those hard questions.
I:Well, is it generally easy or hard for you decide between doing the right thing, and doing the wrong thing?
R:Well, it’s been easy until you come up with a decision where either way doesn’t really make much of a difference.  When it’s like either – because – let me think, knowing the difference between right and wrong.  Well, you can always give the examples like if it doesn’t hurt anyone, or I think the church, that’s good.  It’s got a bunch of rules.  I’m trying to think, and then I’d say the why, I should obey the law.  Yeah, and then let me think.  Then of course something’s like speeding that’s wrong, we know everyone does it.
I:Would you say that deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder for you over the last couple years?
R:It’s probably gotten easier.
I:How come?
R:Because well, I think I’m a little bit more mature because like for example when you’re little it’s like – or when you’re younger it’s sort of like, “Hm, I want to do this,” and it’s like, “Huh, maybe it’s not so wrong.”  Then as you get a little older you realize that “I shouldn’t be doing that.”
I:Yeah.
R:And then maturity, it helps out a little, and now it does actually does give some logic of why certain things are wrong.  You know like –
I:Now, what is it you think that makes something right or wrong?  And you said – you mentioned a few different things, but let’s talk about those.  So one you mentioned if it didn’t hurt anybody.  If it hurts – I’m assuming you mean that if doesn’t – if it hurts somebody it would be wrong.
R:Yeah.
I:Secondly, you said something about the church gives you rules and stuff like that.
R:Yeah.
I:You said stuff about laws.  Well, what is it?  Is it all those, one of those, other stuff?  What is it that makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know.  It’s a hard – I have a friend, I don’t know if you want to interview him, but man, he’d give you – anyway.  I’ll have to think about this.  Because I know sometimes it’s hard to categorically say certain things about – because let me think if I can give a – because one example – well, I have an uncle that totally hates Microsoft.  So categorically anything they come out with he will hate.  So – but then one of my programming professors is like, “It’s not good to categorically say something about something.”  Because I’m reminded of – okay, it reminds me of computer science.  See, we have – what is called?  It’s called FiniteMap, that’s the not the right, no, DiscreteMap.  Basically you can have like a certain number of situations, and then each situation would require a certain rule of what’s right and wrong, but of course, trying to apply a general rule to everything that might come into some problems.  So I know it sounds like a pain, having to enumerate every little thing which is what our laws seem to do.  So let’s see, so that’s – it’s hard to say what makes something right or wrong.  Let me think.  When – because hurting people, or maybe not just – maybe the potential to cause harm.  Like you can give the example of having sex before you’re married, having a baby, or even just – there's laws that say you’re not supposed to speed down the highway because even though you might not hurt anyone, there's a potential that you could hurt someone.
I:So you say it’s like what would happen because you did something wrong.  So what – how does that then – because you were talking about lots of rules, or laws, or whatever, how does – do you think that the rules – this is what I think I’m hearing and tell me if I’m right or wrong.
R:All right.
I:That the rules or laws work to keep bad things – if you follow them, will keep bad things from happening.
R:Pretty much, yeah.  They’re sort of a heuristic.
I:Sort of what?
R:They’re kind of a heuristic because they won’t always work.
I:Okay, but they’re sort trying to think ahead.  It’s okay if you do – this is a bad thing because bad things will happen, so you need to follow that so,
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, but the rules and the laws are sort of intended to keep the bad consequences from happening.
R:Pretty much.","I don’t know.  That’s one of those hard questions. Well, it’s been easy until you come up with a decision where either way doesn’t really make much of a difference.  When it’s like either – because – let me think, knowing the difference between right and wrong.  Well, you can always give the examples like if it doesn’t hurt anyone, or I think the church, that’s good.  It’s got a bunch of rules.  I’m trying to think, and then I’d say the why, I should obey the law.  Yeah, and then let me think.  Then of course something’s like speeding that’s wrong, we know everyone does it. It’s probably gotten easier. Because well, I think I’m a little bit more mature because like for example when you’re little it’s like – or when you’re younger it’s sort of like, “Hm, I want to do this,” and it’s like, “Huh, maybe it’s not so wrong.”  Then as you get a little older you realize that “I shouldn’t be doing that.” And then maturity, it helps out a little, and now it does actually does give some logic of why certain things are wrong.  You know like –  Yeah. Yeah. I don’t know.  It’s a hard – I have a friend, I don’t know if you want to interview him, but man, he’d give you – anyway.  I’ll have to think about this.  Because I know sometimes it’s hard to categorically say certain things about – because let me think if I can give a – because one example – well, I have an uncle that totally hates Microsoft.  So categorically anything they come out with he will hate.  So – but then one of my programming professors is like, “It’s not good to categorically say something about something.”  Because I’m reminded of – okay, it reminds me of computer science.  See, we have – what is called?  It’s called FiniteMap, that’s the not the right, no, DiscreteMap.  Basically you can have like a certain number of situations, and then each situation would require a certain rule of what’s right and wrong, but of course, trying to apply a general rule to everything that might come into some problems.  So I know it sounds like a pain, having to enumerate every little thing which is what our laws seem to do.  So let’s see, so that’s – it’s hard to say what makes something right or wrong.  Let me think.  When – because hurting people, or maybe not just – maybe the potential to cause harm.  Like you can give the example of having sex before you’re married, having a baby, or even just – there's laws that say you’re not supposed to speed down the highway because even though you might not hurt anyone, there's a potential that you could hurt someone. All right. Pretty much, yeah.  They’re sort of a heuristic. They’re kind of a heuristic because they won’t always work. Yeah. Pretty much.","The respondent plans to save most of an inheritance, give 10% to the church based on biblical teachings, and believes that understanding right and wrong has become easier with maturity, emphasizing the importance of not causing harm and adhering to moral standards set by the church and laws, while also expressing a belief in absolute truths over relativism and a moral obligation to help others in life-threatening situations."

R:My discipline as a child and the way I was brought up.
I:By, by whom?
R:By my mother and my grandmother, mainly.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Things that’s right, they help, help you in a positive way and wrong things are usually, have severe consequences like being in jail or even things like just getting a whoopin’ or something.
I:Do you get whoopin’s at your house?
R:No.
I:Ever?
R:Used to.
I:Used to, when, what, did that change at a certain age, or?
R:I think I haven’t had a beatin’ since I was like 9, 10.
I:What do you think changed the form of discipline?
R:I guess I was the youngest and they just decided to just treat me differently and I wasn’t really into too much.","Well, if I, if I know I’m getting myself in trouble with the law, I definitely don’t want to do it and if I get in trouble with my parents, it all depends on the severity of the situation and what I’m doing.  Like, most of the time I wouldn’t do it, especially if I felt like I would get, if I would get caught and in trouble. Yeah. My discipline as a child and the way I was brought up. By my mother and my grandmother, mainly. Things that’s right, they help, help you in a positive way and wrong things are usually, have severe consequences like being in jail or even things like just getting a whoopin’ or something. No. Used to. I think I haven’t had a beatin’ since I was like 9, 10. I guess I was the youngest and they just decided to just treat me differently and I wasn’t really into too much.","The respondent makes decisions based on the potential consequences of their actions, particularly avoiding trouble with the law and their parents, and attributes their understanding of right and wrong to the discipline instilled by their mother and grandmother, while also acknowledging the influence of peers in their choices regarding drinking and smoking.","I:Okay, how do you decide what’s good and bad and right and wrong in life?
R:Um, the things that I feel that are good and bad, I kind of decided on how it makes me feel.  Like if I’m, if I feel good about something that I’ve done I’m thinking about doing, it’s good and if I’m, I’m like conscious about it and it’s constantly bothering me, I feel like it’s a bad thing.  Especially when I know that it puts somebody else in jeopardy or in pain.
I:Okay, and then in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Generally it’s easy but there’s always times when you don’t really have that clarity.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or more difficult over the past couple of years?
R:It’s probably gotten a little difficult but only in one area of my life.
I:And what’s that?
R:In my relationship with my girl.
I:Can you elaborate a little bit?
R:Well, like I always, I never wanted to lie to her and I never wanted to not be faithful but, on two different occasions it happened but like I said how when I know something is bad, I hear it, it’s like a conscious thing, it’s never, it didn’t bother me.
I:So how did you decide what to do?
R:I didn’t.  I acted, I just acted with the flesh you know what I mean.  I followed with my what I wanted to do.
I:Okay.  And then, what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think its point of view that makes something right or wrong, but for the most part it’s society you know, cause the majority of the people are the ones who makes the laws and tells you what’s right and wrong but, I believe it’s point of view.
I:Can you tell me more about like what do you mean by point of view?
R:Like, if you see me shoot somebody down in the street you automatically assume that I’m wrong without but, for me, I could be right because the same person that I just gunned down in the street killed my brother or they threatened my family or something, so that’s my reason, that’s my point of view.  And the same way, then you gotta deal with the same thing in the court room.  If the jury may say that I’m wrong because they threatened my family the didn’t hurt them, or they did hurt my family but it was years ago and I can’t prove it but I, for me I know who it was, so point of view, that’s how I feel about it.
I:And then are there any actions that you think are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:No, I don’t.  I think it always depends on the situation.  Always.
I:Alright, and from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Um--
I:You know, where do they come from?
R:Um, I’m really not sure cause it’s like, it just, I’ve just changed.  My views have changed over time, cause, you know, my parents try to instill in me what was right and wrong, and then from there I just grew into what I felt was right and wrong as I got understanding for more, cause, you know, they tell you what’s wrong and what’s right but they never tell you why, and as I started understanding that why, and thinking of other possibilities, that’s how I developed my own version of right and wrong.","Um, the things that I feel that are good and bad, I kind of decided on how it makes me feel.

How do you normally decide or know what’s good or bad or right or wrong in life?
R:From my parents.  I mean, my family’s just - they’ve always kinda guided me towards what’s right and what’s wrong.  And after a while, you kinda just get a sense for it.  Like, you don’t need somebody to tell you, especially if you .  You just kinda know, like, this ain’t the right thing to do.
I:Yeah.  I mean, I understand what you’re saying.  You sort of acquired your moral views from your parents and the people bringing you up.  So you feel like after a while, you just kinda know.  Do you think that we all know?  Or just from experiencing it?  Or what?
R:Well, I guess for me, I would say kinda like how you mold yourself to think.  Like, I always - I kinda look at myself as the good guy.  I don’t really do the wrong thing.  Like, people ask me - even now, people ask me to do certain things, like they want me to ride around with them in a stolen car or something that’s not so crazy.  This guy wanted me to help him do a fight club, and he just wanted me there just to, like, help patch people up and stop the bleeding and stuff like that.  And to me - yeah, it sounds cool.  But at the same time, like, nah.  Like, the cops run in there, you’re all getting picked up.  So it’s like, when they ask me things like that, I kinda laugh at them like, “Yo, you know I’m a good guy.  I’m not gonna do that, man.  You know I don’t do stuff like that.”
I:So in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I say now, it’s easy.  Now, it’s easy.
I:And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier over the past couple of years or harder?
R:It’s gotten easier.  I guess I’m comfortable with doing what I feel is right.  And it’s been keeping me out of trouble this long, so -
I:Now, have your moral views changed in the past couple of years?
R:No.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Well, that’s basically - you can look at it two ways.  Either you can look at it from a moral perspective, like whether you personally think it’s right or wrong, or you can look at it as socially accepted.  Because a lot of what people say is right and wrong, it’s just what people say as a majority.  Like, a lot of people don’t think polygamy is acceptable because that’s just how most of the societies, especially here in America - everybody has one wife.  But, like, in Africa - that it’s normal.  If you have the money to pay for that - I mean, support your family, then it’s ok.  So it’s more like the society that you’re in.
I:Ok.  So for you, what makes something right or wrong is - and I understand what you’re saying about right and wrong.  It’s some kind of dictated by society.  But for you, what makes something right or wrong?
R:For me, it’s more so, like, how I was taught and for me morally because as far as the society says, I’m more, like - I’m open-minded.  So like, as far as polygamy goes or homosexuality, that stuff doesn’t affect me at all.  It’s not really a big deal.
I:All right.  So you feel it’s like the rules or the laws, the consequences, how it feels God’s will, a combination of those things?  I don’t know.  I mean, what do you think?
R:Well, it’s a combination.  I mean, when you look at the laws and stuff, I mean, they were all made up by a few people.  And this is what these few people together thought was right or wrong.  Like I said, it goes back into, like, the social thing because over here, it may be wrong to kill somebody after they invaded your home or they did something to your family, but somewhere else, like in Africa - if they accuse you of raping somebody - a female - they’ll tie the guys up to the pole and use a big boulder whip and beat all of them and whoever gets grabbed up into the situation, and that’s ok for them.  That’s how their laws are.  That’s what they decided was right.  That’s how they felt like they should deal with the situation.
I:Now, you said - you talked a little bit about where you get your moral views - from your parents.
R:Yeah.
I:Is there any other influence you find on your moral views?
R:Just how - I guess my conscience.  Like, if I feel like I’m gonna do something, and I’m constantly gonna keep thinking about and possibly have regrets about it, then I won’t do it.  Like, somewhere along the line, I think that this view that I don’t wanna live my life with any regrets, so I try not to do anything that I think I’ll have regrets about in the future.","From my parents.

R:Mostly, yeah, cause if I know it’s wrong, I like get a, that feeling in like your stomach that you’re like oh man, I’m gonna do something wrong, you know, and I just think, I’m like okay, if my parents would see me doing this, what would they think, and I’m like, hey, if they wouldn’t like it, then it’s probably wrong.
I:Right, well how about something like, like lying to you know, your friend ask you, do I look fat, you know, yes, maybe she does, you know, and you know, you don’t want to hurt her feelings, so, you know, you lie, oh no, you know, something like that, where it’s—
R:I’m pretty about those things.
I:But would you think it’s okay to lie in that situation?  It’s not?
R:No.
I:No, okay.
R:Like, I wouldn’t be like, hey, yeah, you look fat, but I’d be like, I don’t know, you could wear something better.","I can’t really say that there is, no, there is, yeah, there is a right or wrong, cause like I don’t think it’s right at all, so, for abortions, I don’t know, cause like in the Bible it says like you shouldn’t kill people or anything, you know, and so then like, that’s what you’re doing, you know, you’re killing the baby. And the death penalty?  You know, I just think that’s horrible, I think it’s wrong, because it’s like the government’s like telling you like not to kill people and then like to justify the killing that’s going on in the world, they kill.  You know?  It’s just really, I don’t know. Like, I don’t know, what I base them on?  I don’t know, just like from what my parents have taught me and like what I learn in church and youth group and stuff. Um, I don’t know, usually everything’s pretty clear to me, but, I don’t know, I can’t really, I don’t know, it’s like I either know it’s right or wrong, cause, like I don’t know, just like a feeling I get, you know?

And another switching gears, but how do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I don’t know.  I guess, like, I’m just - I just know.  Like, there are just some things that you just don’t do.  If it’s against the law, you don’t do it.  Well, for the most part.  Like, I guess I drank before I was 21 even though that was against the law, but I still did it.  But if it’s gonna harm somebody, obviously that’s wrong, and I wouldn’t do that.  Like, that’s the main thing.
I:So, like, the first consequence of it –
R:Yeah.
I:Are what you’re talking about?
R:Yeah.
I:How - in general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Pretty easy, I would say.
I:And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:It’s exactly the same.  I’ve never really had a problem doing the right thing, so -
I:Ok.  Have your views about right and wrong changed in the past two years?
R:No.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Just the consequences.  If you’re gonna hurt somebody or someone’s property or, like, upset anybody else, and if it has, like - if anybody else can get, like, hurt, it’s wrong.
I:What if you’re not affecting anybody else’s life?
R:It’s ok.
I:All right.  Where have you acquired your moral views from?
R:My parents.  Whatever they’ve taught me, I guess, and I’ve gone from there.
I:What do you mean you’ve “gone from there”?
R:Just make up my own mind.  Like, they told me sex before marriage was wrong, and I decided for myself.  For a while, I believed that.  Then I just, like knew everything, and then I decided I don’t really see why it’s wrong, as long as you’re serious with the person that - you know?  It’s not just, like, going out and having sex with everybody often or something.
I:Do you think your friends influence, like, the decisions you make?  Or is it just sort of a common sense thing?

R:Mostly from my parents and from my friends and what they’re doing and it’s basically been in me since I was little, it’s like don’t touch that, it’s hot, that’s wrong, or don’t color on the walls, that’s wrong, don’t eat that, it’s wrong.  And then it’s like study hard, that’s right.  And sometimes you’re just kind of like, no, I don’t feel like doing that and it’s wrong not to but at the same time it’s like I don’t feel like doing that.
I:Okay, um, so what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know.  I think  I think it just depends on the situation, and that um, I don’t think there really is a wrong thing, I think you make it to be a wrong thing, like cause if you’re gonna sit there and do it and you should be able to justify it and say I think it’s right, I, it shouldn’t be like you have to defend what you do.  So.
I:Okay so um, how in general do you decide what’s like good and bad in life?
R:After it happens.
I:It, so is it like an outcome thing?
R:Yeah I think as soon as it’s over with, and I get yelled at or I get praised for it or whatever, then I finally am like, mm, that was a good thing or that was a really bad thing, don’t do that again.
I:Okay, um, can you give me some examples of things that, that in your life are really ah, good or bad.
R:It’s like—
I:Decisions you’ve made, or?
R:Not to go up to the lake, cause I know I’m gonna get in trouble when I do that.  And then it’s like lying to your parents about it if you do it anyway. That’s not good.
I:What makes that not good?
R:It’s just the whole yelling thing, it’s not good.
I:Um, so how do you think that that’s gonna change when you’re no longer living at home with your Mom and Dad?
R:I think I’ll be a lot more independent and I’ll probably think about it a whole lot more cause I’ll be like how is this gonna look, what if my parents are there or I’ll be out drinking or something and my parents, and I’m like mm, I’m not supposed to be there.
I:Okay so you think that later on—
R:I think there’ll be the whole Mommy and Daddy are watching, you know that’ll be a little weird.
I:Still kind of think about what they would think?
R:Mm-mm (yes).","Mostly from my parents and from my friends and what they’re doing and it’s basically been in me since I was little, it’s like don’t touch that, it’s hot, that’s wrong, or don’t color on the walls, that’s wrong, don’t eat that, it’s wrong.

R:I guess I just go with like heart and head decisions first.  And you know if that’s wrong then just kind of learn from that.
I:What do you mean by that, the heart and head?
R:You go with what your head, like with what you think and then with what your heart says you should do.  And then, I mean cause if you don’t have your heart in a decision, then there’s no point in doing it anyway.
I:And when you say heart, do you mean the way you feel about things?
R:Yeah, the way that I feel.
I:Okay.  In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s usually pretty easy, there’s some where I know I should do something, or I shouldn’t do something but it’s hard because it’s what’s acceptable and what’s not.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Pretty easy, cause I’ve eliminated a lot of stuff in my life that I don’t need to be doing.  That I know I don’t need to be doing.
I:Do you think that doing the right thing comes kind of naturally or is it kind of hard?
R:Sometimes its kind of hard, but sometimes you just know.
I:So why would you say it’s gotten easier?
R:Because there’s a lot of stuff that I used to do, I used to do so, like I was into so much, like bad things, and I just decided one day, like this isn’t, this isn’t right for me, so.
I:So like bad things like partying a lot?
R:Yeah, I was big into that.
I:Okay, so like drinking or doing drugs?
R:Yeah, stuff like that, and then I just decided that this isn’t me.  So.
I:Anything else that you did at parties in general?
R:Not, I guess it was just that.  It was just the drinking and the drugs, and then I would like drive home and I was like 14 and 15 driving home.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I guess there’s like a set right and wrong that society puts on you.  And then it’s what you think is right and wrong.  I mean if they clash, then sometimes it’s society saying you shouldn’t drink, you shouldn’t have sex, you shouldn’t do this, but if you fee that’s right for you, there’s nobody that can sit there and tell you, no that’s wrong because such and such says.  Cause the world says it’s wrong. So you just kind of have to go by what you think.
I:So what kind of feeling or thought, how do people come to conclusions about what’s right and wrong.  Where do you think those feelings come from?
R:I guess it’s just how you were raised.  Like my parents raised me how to think of right and wrong, how to be my own person, not to rely on a set of rules or whatever to go by.  So you get a lot of it from your parents or the people you’re around, the friends you choose.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:I don’t think, I guess it all depends on the person.  It might be wrong, but for you it might be the perfect thing.  You know what’s right for them.
I:So why do you think that?
R:Because everybody’s different, there’s not a set person that is duplicated in the world.  I mean there are people who believe different things than I do but I’m not saying they’re wrong, they’re not bad people.  But it’s just not the right thing for me, it’s just different things for different people.
I:Okay.  What about things that are always right, do you think there are actions that are always right in and of themselves?
R:No.  I mean, that’s hard, because I cant sit there and be like, it’s right and it be completely wrong for someone else.  But I guess it just depends on the person.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:My parents, and my parents friends.
I:How would you say you’ve gotten your sense of right and wrong from them?
R:They just, it’s like when you’re little.  They’re like, don’t do this, don’t do that, no, no, no.

R:My parents taught me when I was younger.
I:And in general is it easy or hard for you for you to do?
R:Very easy.  It hasn’t .  Easier because now I don’t have my parents to tell me, “You can’t do that because it’s wrong” and then me be like, “Watch it, I’m about to do it anyway,” and now I live by myself and I’m just kind of like, “You know maybe not such a good idea.  Maybe not so good.”
I:So have your views on what’s right or wrong changed much over the last few years?
R:I don’t think they’ve changed like what I think is right and wrong, but I think it’s made me more aware of what’s right for me may be wrong for someone else or what’s wrong for me may be okay for somebody else.  I think it’s made me more aware of other people’s feelings about things.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it’s your own personal belief system.  I don’t think it’s anything, like social norms or anything like that.  I think it’s just what you think.  I don’t think there’s a book that says smoking is wrong and not smoking is right.  I think it’s dependent on each person and their own beliefs and what they think is right or wrong.
I:What kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:If it’s illegal.  I don’t think that stealing is, definitely getting caught stealing is definitely wrong because you’re going to get in trouble.  You’re gonna have to pay fine and you could go to jail.  Probably just the legal-ness of it I guess, that’s not even a word, but…

I:So it comes from God and it’s known through the Bible and conscience.
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Is that what you’re—
R:That’s what I think.
I:Any, any other way we know where morality comes from?
R:Well I think also that you, you need to follow your parents, you know? So when they set guidelines for you, if you don’t follow them it’s right or wrong.  So.
I:So it may not even be a moral thing, but just the fact that your parents told you?
R:Yeah it’s either, I think it’s either conscience, parents, morals, or God.
I:Mm-mm, okay.  Um, have, have you ever been in situations, you said you, you’ve always known what’s right or wrong.  Have you ever been in situations where it was sort of ambiguous and you didn’t know how to apply what your parents taught you or what the Bible teaches or anything?
R:Mm-mm (no).
I:You’ve always, it’s all pretty—

R:Yeah.

Like if you’re afraid for someone to know what you’re doing, then you shouldn’t be doing it. Yeah. God. Yeah. God gives you your conscience.  You know? Yeah. And like if you read your Bible you know, he says, he, you know what I mean?  It says, it gives you rules, 10 commandments. Honor your father and mother, that doesn’t happen a lot, you know? Like. Mm-mm (yes). That’s what I think. Well I think also that you, you need to follow your parents, you know? So when they set guidelines for you, if you don’t follow them it’s right or wrong.  So.

R:Um, you know when you’re little, I was taught the 10 commandments and stuff, so now I know them, so now it’s just instinct whether I know what’s right or wrong.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s pretty easy.  There’s a couple things that you know, I might have to think a little bit but I still know when I’m done.
I:Like what kind of things?
R:I don’t know, just um, if I should watch something or not, um, uh, copying homework.
I:Okay.  So what do you do in those situations?
R:Just think about it.  And I usually know, like I’ve been taught about all the morals or something so I just have to think about it and I pretty much know just about anything, can I take that bite and not be stealing, no I cant do that.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Napkin, no here it is.
I:I don’t need any, I haven’t learned any civilization.
R:Uh, probably easier, I wouldn’t say it’s gotten harder.
I:It’s about the same?
R:Yeah.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Just, well the Bible pretty much says what everything is, so that, that’s the final say on it.  But um, I don’t know, your conscience I think.  As long as you haven’t killed it by that time.  Your conscience pretty much just lets you know.  Would it be okay to take this person’s money or if I find this on the floor, I probably should turn it into lost and found.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Uh, I don’t think there really is.  Like rape, I don’t think you could justify that that would be right, but as for things like lying and stuff like that, there are some situations, like if during World War, (waitress interrupts), like during World War II, if a Nazi knocked on your door and asked if you had any Jews in there and you did, I’m pretty sure it would be okay to lie for that situation.
I:Right.
R:So I’d say there are situations, extreme situations where you could do it or not do it and it wouldn’t be wrong.
I:So like you mentioned rape as something that would always be wrong.  What makes that wrong?  Why is it wrong?
R:I don’t know, it’s just wrong.  It’s just, it’s just violates stuff, it’s committing adultery, it’s forcing something on someone that they don’t like.  It’s abuse, it’s just that conscience thing again, that just says it’s wrong, it’s not really a specific reason.
I:Okay, so what if a person just didn’t have that, didn’t feel that, and thought it was okay?
R:Well then you know, I don’t know what person you’d be able to find that, but if there was a person,
I:Like a psychopath, a sociopath.
R:But then you have to think of the other person, you know, do you think he liked that.  And if he did, then you wouldn’t report it to the cops, but obviously that would be,
I:But apart from getting caught, why should the person who doesn’t care, care about what the other person thinks about at all, do you think?
R:Well, the Bible says do unto others as you would have do unto you.

R:Umm most of the time I just, I just think about like if my parents was there would I do it.  Or if like somebody, somebody really close to me was there would I do it.  And that’s what lets me know if it is right or wrong.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s pretty easy.  When I was younger it used to be hard, I was like there aint nothing wrong with doing this alright. It’s doing this, it’s just doing that. It’s pretty easy to decide right and wrong now.  I guess cuz like when I was younger I always kind of like psyched myself out of believing some of the things I do was wrong just because it seemed fine at the time.
I:So over the past couple of years you feel like it’s gotten easier to decide between right and wrong?
R:Yah I wouldn’t say deciding has it’s gotten easier to do the right things cuz I mean I think it’s pretty easy for anybody to decide right and wrong but the hard part is deciding whether you are going to do the right thing or not.
I:Now why do you feel that has changed for you actually because you are talking about actually doing right versus doing wrong not actually deciding what’s right and wrong?  Why do you think that’s gotten easier?
R:Maturity and uhh starting to hang out with more like more calm people than what I used to cuz I used to hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd like for a while.  Umm I know like I used to, I used to stay out really late and everything and I had friends that like if you want to do it, like a lot of my friends had the mind set of if you want to do it, do it.  It’s I mean basically it’s your life, can’t nobody run you.  I used to hang out with those kind of people.  And like now, now like I hang out with people whose got more, like more responsibility and so like I know it’s like that cuz now I have more responsibility and so I guess it’s like me, I have maturity and responsibility.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Umm probably like morals and ethics behind it.
I:What do you mean by that?
R:Like if uhh somebody or some people might think that like uhh say like if, like if somebody, like if somebody looks at your girlfriend or what ever.  Some people like some people actually might think that it’s right to you just, to confront that person and like you know just get violent with them just because  you know they looked at your girl.  You’d be like she’s my girl you shouldn’t be looking at her.  I think, I think that’s in-moral cuz there is actually no logic behind it. And umm so and with the ethics like ethics if it’s I say like if something is really un-ethical like you do something just to do it, like say like people, people be like nobody got hurt from it, nobody that you know got hurt from it.  Nobody that’s in like your immediate little circle got hurt from it.  Like you could be, say like if you say that like you horse playing around you’d break a window they are like nobody got hurt from it, aint nobody get hurt, nobody had to go to the hospital or nothing so people are like it wasn’t wrong and we were just playing around and it happened, that’s not right either, somebody has to pay for the window.  So you can’t say nobody was hurt from it.  Cuz that hurt somebody’s finances right there.
I:O.k. so now you are talking a little bit about the consequences of like peoples actions right cuz that’s a consequence of something you did,  uhh because before you were talking a little bit about you know the moral and ethical side of it and now you are talking about so consequences to make something wrong or?
R:Yah,  cuz if it like, basically if nah cuz you can’t even say if, if uhh if somebody benefits from it than it’s right.  Cuz somebody can rob a bank and I mean you benefit from it cuz you end up with a lot of money but it’s not right.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:From my mom and uhh basically it’s like little shit that I have learned or acquired over the years.
I:Through?
R:Experience.","Umm most of the time I just, I just think about like if my parents was there would I do it.  Or if like somebody, somebody really close to me was there would I do it.

R:Excuse me, how do I know what is good-I trust my heart and my conscience.  I have a fairly strong conscience I think just from growing up in a, um, I mean some people say sheltered life, which it has been, but just strict and stuff, so I usually go with my gut feeling and it’s most of the time right.  If I don’t know what is right or wrong or what I should do, I pray about it, or ask my parents in their wisdom, what would you do?  and I don’t always agree with what they say, so I guess that’s opinion type stuff and then it will kind of be up to me to weigh the options, well they said this but I don’t really feel right about it, so what do I feel?
I:Okay, so when you have prayed do you feel like you get an answer?
R:Most of the time, yeah, like for me, like this job transition I didn’t know what to do because I was already planning on quitting my job when I got back from India because I just need to move on, I’ve been working at Goodwill for too long and then this opportunity came up so I was like what do I do?  Like my new boss will let me take the time off to go to India and come back, he goes to my church actually and so he’s supportive of missions and stuff.  So I was praying about it and for me I prayed that if it wasn’t a good switch, that I would feel really uneasy and just really hesitant about it, but if it would be a good switch and that if I should, um, change jobs and stuff, that I would just be completely at peace about it and like everything would work out, like talking to my boss and giving my notice and stuff like that and everything just worked out so smoothly, like I could not have worked out those details as perfectly as they happened so I give God all the credit and I'm trusting that he lined everything up so that’s what I feel.
I:And about how often do you pray?
R:All day long , a lot.  I don’t think I could really count how like many times, but I do pray throughout the day, not just for meals or whatever but if I have some time to myself or even like at my job while working and I’ll just be talking to God.
I:So it’s like it, it’s more like a conversation?
R:Yeah, like my relationship with God is not like, I don’t know I guess it’s not all official like have to be this big thing about praying to God, it’s just talking to God, like it’s a relationship like me talking to you and um, and it is two ways, so yeah, it’s just like okay God I'm having a really tough day, just help me through it, just I need some encouragement, send me something along the way, help me keep going, so yeah.
I:And so do you feel like you’re, as you get older that deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder?
R:I think that I would actually say that it’s getting a little bit harder.  Um,  I'm trying to think how I would explain that.  I think because I’ve, I'm kind of like now on my own, light out from underneath my parents’ wing, like belief-wise, I'm not just like my parents say this so I do it, so it’s more like I mean whether you’re talking about faith and religion or not, it’s just like the way I live my life so I don’t always have them to fall back on, I have to make my decisions myself and like I said sometimes I don’t like to ask my parents because I want to figure it out by myself so I guess it’s been tough and sometimes I’ve made the wrong decision and I learn from it and stuff, so but it’, I think also just growing up, having more options anywhere you go, where, I don’t know, anything you do, should I go to the mall or not today, that’s not a right and wrong thing, but um, yeah just in general.
I:Okay, a little harder?
R:Yeah.
I:What do you think it is that makes something a right or wrong thing?
R:For me I have to in my own life line it up against the Bible, like what God says is right or wrong.  I guess, um, but some people will say like well he doesn’t say in the Bible do not smoke, but for me it’s like well I know he says to keep a clean and pure body so why would you pollute it with something like that so that’s kind of what I base my decisions off of, it’s like what, I mean yeah they have like those bracelets like: what would Jesus do?  But it is kind of do, would Jesus seriously be doing this?  Would God be happy if he walked in the room and I'm sitting here doing this?  Would he be proud of me or not?  So, yeah.","Excuse me, how do I know what is good-I trust my heart and my conscience.

I:Harder, why?
R:I don’t know, it’s just,
I:When you said harder, was there something that came to mind that made you think of that?
R:I’m going to say like going out, you know, there’s been times when I’ve spent the night at a friends house, and she’s like “let’s go to a party, we’ll be right back.”  And I’m just like I really want to go but I know I shouldn’t.  But you know, so like stuff, you know.
I:So you feel like there’s almost more opportunities for you to do bad things so it makes it harder?
R:Yeah, like, and they’re like we don’t even have to drink, we can just go just to be there and to have fun.  And I’m like, I don’t know.  Well, that’s what I mean by harder.
I:So it was hard.  I just want to make sure.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:(pause) What do I think it is that makes something?
I:Uh-huh.
R:Uh, I think what you feel.
I:What you feel?
R:Uh-huh.
I:And what do you mean by that?
R:Uh, like if I’m going somewhere, or I’m doing something you know and it feels wrong you know, then I know I shouldn’t be doing it.
I:So when you say feels wrong, is there a sort of particular thing that it sort of feels?
R:It’s like in the back of my head.
I:Okay, where do you think these feelings come from in your view?
R:If I’ve been, like not to disobey, I’ve never really went against my parents wishes.  There has been a few times when I have and you know, I feel bad, just I don’t know where it comes from, it just feels bad.
I:Okay, that makes sense.  So based on a feeling, that’s exactly what you’re saying.  So um, push on this a little bit more.  Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?

I:Yeah, like are there any things that someone might do, or that you might do, that would always be wrong?

R:I’m gonna say both.  Easier because I’ve grown up more, but in some ways it’s also gotten harder so I guess it’s a little of both.
I:So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Like how do you know?
R:I, like me personally?
I:Yes.
R:I don’t know.  I guess it’s just a gut feeling.  You just know.
I:Well okay, so where do you think that feeling comes from?  What is it that triggers the gut feeling?
R:I don’t know.  I just feel it.  I just know it’s right.
I:Yeah, definitely.  So from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Family, growing up, religion.","Morals, the morals that I grew up with. Yeah and also, I just I know what I want. I know how it makes me feel.

Um, let's see, where would you say your own views of right and wrong come from?
R:Probably my parents and school, stuff like that.
I:Uh-huh, um, what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:If it’s bad for you, um, if it’s illegal, um,   if you won’t want your parents to know that you’re doing it and stuff like that.
I:Okay, um, let's see, so do you think everything that is illegal is morally wrong?
R:Not everything cause there’s some kind of stupid laws, like once before, my brothers, they built a tree house in the backyard and we didn’t know there was a law where you couldn’t have a tree house where we live, so they made us take it down, so that’s a dumb law.
I:Okay. Um, so um, let's see, so how do you know um if something is like bad for you then that makes it right or wrong, then, do you know?

I:Okay.  sorry.

R:M11:Yes.
I:Um, what about something that’s not quite as um risky, like speeding?
R:Um,
I:Would you think that’s morally wrong or?
R:Um, I don't know I don’t think it’s morally wrong.  You shouldn’t do it cause you could get in an accident, but I don't know a lot of people speed, so,
I:Okay, so um, let's see, so what would you do if you were unsure how if something was right or wrong like if you weren’t sure if it would hurt you or not?
R:Um, I'd probably ask my parents or something like that.
I:Okay, um, so how do you decide like what’s right or wrong or good and bad in life, would you say?
R:Um,
I:Take your time.
R:Probably if it’s bad for you and like if my parents told me not to do it and if it was illegal and those kinds of things.
I:Do you think your parents are always right when they tell you something’s right or wrong?
R:Uh, yeah, kind of.
I:Has there, can you think of a time where they might have been wrong?
R:I don't know I think really sometimes like cause we have a town curfew, if they make you come in before that, like if you go to the movies, like through the week cause there’s no school in the summer and the curfew here is like 10:30 on the weekdays and if you go to see like a movie that starts at like 9:00 you probably won’t be home by 10:30, so I think that’s stupid.","Probably their parents, and maybe school and stuff like that.

R:Probably, I don’t know. I think at a certain age you just kind of know what you should do and what you shouldn’t do but I don’t know sorry…
I:In general, how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Not too hard.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:I’d say easier. When I was younger I was more likely to be influenced by friends of what they thought was right or wrong, but now I kind of have my own.
I:Have your views about what was right and wrong changed in the past two years?
R:Probably not too much. When I was younger, we talked really goofy things, Halloween egg stuff or something like that. Now I would say, “No, I shouldn’t do that because someone’s got to clean it up tomorrow.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Okay, I would say everyone has their own values so that’s kind of hard to answer. I would say, as long as it’s not, it’s illegal, it’s probably wrong. But other than that, I don’t know. Everyone has their own beliefs, but I kind of believe, you know, you know if there are things that are wrong, like stealing, lying, stuff like that. But somehow people do lie for good reasons; I will say that, nothing, it’s right to lie…
I:So if they lie for good reasons, could it be okay?
R:Oh, that’s a tough one. I would say it depends on a situation maybe, but it kind of still is wrong. Lying is wrong. But if you’re … I don’t know, it still is probably wrong but maybe you think it’s the right thing to do at the time. Yeah, like that.
I:So it depends on being like, people acting like right and wrong or is it always like depended upon the context?
R:I think it depends upon the context, maybe. But I don’t know.
I:That’s a tough one.
R:Yeah.
I:I understand. So what kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:Making everyone mad at you, upset with you, making everyone and the one you love and care about and think you did the wrong thing, or going to jail.
I:It should sort of … if something is right, it’s a jive with what other people think is right.
R:Usually yes, but not always because sometimes you can have a crappy group of people that think something’s right when it really is wrong.
I:Yeah and how would you know?
R:I don’t know. The people I’m close to, I pretty much know they’re all good people, so they wouldn’t usually tell you to do something that’s definitely wrong, especially like my mother or something like that.
I:How do you think your mother knows what’s right and wrong?
R:Probably religion. That’s all I would say is, probably she’s very influenced by religious beliefs. So sometimes, her right and wrong is different than mine because she’s very, very influenced by religion and I’m not so much. A little bit but not as much as her.
I:Yeah. That makes sense. From where have you acquired your moral views?

I:Well then but it raises the question, why is it against the law?
R:Yeah, because people mostly think that’s wrong.  And I think people who do it, too, probably think it’s wrong in some way.  Like generally wrong, but, they don’t care.
I:What about, go to an extreme, just murdering somebody.  Is that wrong?
R:Obviously I think that’s wrong!
I:Why?
R:Because it’s taking someone’s life.  Who, because it is  because I’ve been told it’s wrong?
I:Well I mean, there are people that don’t think it’s wrong, I mean they’re a different, Saddam Hussein, you know other—
R:He, he wasn’t—
I:Other people that think, who cares?
R:He wasn’t raised to think it was wrong, the kind of environment he probably lives in and grew up to be in.
I:So is he right or is he wrong?  Or is it?
R:To me he’s very wrong.
I:Or is it for him he’s wrong—right, but for you?
R:For him he’s right and for me it’s very wrong.
I:So which one of you is right?
R:Me.
I:Because?
R:Because I think I’m right, so I’m right to me .
I:So is it just get down to the assertion of will?  Who, whoever has the most power will determine who’s right and wrong?
R:Yeah, I mean if the government, who had the police force was saying murder’s okay, then it would be okay, pretty much, even if people, other people thought it was wrong, it’s whoever has the most power, that happens everywhere, it happens in schools, that happens in the whole…
I:So morality is nothing beyond, I just want to make sure I understand, you’re saying morality is, there’s nothing to morality or behind morality other than just what people can agree on?
R:Yeah, and like people can agree on and people end up learning their morals from other people, you can’t just pick them up, like you could, but people don’t.
I:So what is it that, what if, so if everyone came to agree um, on what, stealing other people’s babies and torturing them was just acceptable entertainment, then that would be the case?
R:I hope not  but—
I:Or is there, or is there—
R:But it would be the case, they would think it was acceptable entertainment.
I:Right, right.  So for example, some people would say, well there’s just a natural law in the universe of right and wrong, and other people would say it comes from God.
R:Most of that’s been made from, I was gonna say, mostly that’s, that view of well there’s just a natural right and wrong, comes from religion, which is also why I think religion’s a good type of thing to have but I don’t, like without religion, probably society would never have evolved in the way it does cause people need reasons for things to make, oh, well, God says that was right, da da da, people obviously—I think the people who originally made religion didn’t actually, probably made it for some of them, made it to control and yeah, to control, that’s my theory.
I:But if people no longer believe in God or religion, then why should they believe in the morals that that religion produced?
R:Cause they don’t think, they probably wouldn’t think of them as morals from a religion?  They would think of them as social morals, cause that’s what they’ve turned into, but they came from that, if, the idea of natural right and wrong, came originally from religion, I mean, the constitution came from religion, that’s how our whole government is run.
I:Right, so let me, just so I understand this, let’s suppose um, by the time we’re senior citizens, some sort of racist fascist dictatorship comes to power in this country and says if you’re not beautiful, if you don’t have nice genetics and if, if you’re not wealthy, we’re gonna dispose of you.  We might say for us, that’s objectionable, we don’t agree with that, but we, we couldn’t, you’re saying we couldn’t make the claim this is in and of itself regardless of what anybody thinks, just wrong.
R:We could.  The people who think it was wrong could very easily say it’s wrong.
I:But based on what, though, we would say it’s wrong for us but beyond that?  If everyone else has changed their mind then we just say?
R:There’s pretty much nothing you can do about it unless you can get enough people to change, or get them away.  That’s just the way things work.
I:All right, okay.  Um, all right.  Now, bringing it back down from philosophical stuff!
R:","That’s against the law. Yeah, because people mostly think that’s wrong.  And I think people who do it, too, probably think it’s wrong in some way.  Like generally wrong, but, they don’t care.

And uh…and that’s basically all I can think of right now.","The respondent believes that right and wrong are determined by the consequences of actions, acknowledges the influence of their parents on their moral views, admits to having acted against their better judgment in the past, and expresses a lack of guilt over their wrongdoings, while also recognizing that societal norms shape perceptions of morality.","I:Yeah.  Okay.  So, how do you your, how do you, yourself, decide or how do you know what’s good or bad or right and wrong in life?
R:Um.  I usually just say what I think and what I know is bad or right.  I mean, there are things that other people like I guess police or the law would say is bad, was wrong, but I wouldn’t and there are some things that I think is right that shouldn’t be right.  So, I don’t know, I just, I follow my own ways, usually, which is risky, but.
I:Okay.  So, where do you think it comes from, um, when, I don’t know how to put this.  How, you said that you kind of decide what’s right or wrong for yourself.  Do you have any sense how you decide, like where, what you base it on?  Are there kind of general principles that guide you in terms of what you think is right or wrong?
R:Just what I’ve learned from, like, my friends or older brother and what I’ve experienced myself and what I think I shouldn’t have gotten in trouble for something I did, or ah, just, basically.
I:Okay.  So you mentioned this older brother, do you talk to him much and get advice from him and?
R:No.  He’s in jail.
I:Okay.  So, what’s he in jail for?
R:Um.  Some people he was hanging out with drugged him and ah, basically he had a gun and he shot at some people and almost killed someone but didn’t, but since he was drugged, he didn’t get attempted murder, because he wasn’t in a right mind for him or whatever, and so ah.
I:Have you been in touch with him too, while he’s in jail?
R:No, because they keep moving him around, so I don’t know where he’s at.
I:Yeah.  Well, do you typically think it’s easy or hard to decide what’s right or wrong?
R:Easy.
I:It comes pretty quickly?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  Has it gotten any harder or easier over the last couple years, do you think?
R:To what?
I:Deciding between right and wrong.
R:Oh, it’s gotten easier, I think.
I:Why do you think that is?
R:Ah, just because, I don’t know, just like conscious music that I be listening to, like ah, I don’t know, I’ll be listening to like hip hop music, revolutionary music and stuff, so, that, you know, informing me about stuff that I didn’t really know about, that the government tries to hide, just like, where drugs really come from and all this, who really brings everything in and what the government does behind people’s back, you know, things they don’t want you to know but are true.
I:Okay.  So you feel like there’s a lot of messages in the music that you listen to that are helping you kind of form what you think is right or wrong?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something either right or wrong?
R:Ah.  I’m not sure.
I:I guess, sort of back to that, are there general principles, like do you think about the consequences or is it just how it feels or do you take it from what other people say or?
R:It’s like consequences, but like depending on what the situation was, because, with some things, there could be a situation where it could be bad consequences but you know, I don’t think that I’m doing like something like graffiti, as an example, like I mean, if I go, like I see maybe not getting, not doing graffiti on like a building that is running and working, but going down to abandoned buildings and you know freight trains and you know do something, and not just like, just like gang stuff, like actually do something that’s an art form you know, comes from the heart or whatever, you know, I know that’s highly illegal, but I don’t think people should get in trouble because it’s not like I’m just tagging whatever, you know, I’m doing something that looks nice and you know, and brings, it brings to, I don’t know, some people think that, some people find that stuff highly interesting and I think it looks highly  nice and you know, it’s a type of creativity.","Um.

I:You will know.
R:Like beating somebody up and taking the money, I know that’s wrong.
I:Why?  Why do you know that’s wrong?
R:Cause they work for their money and they should be able to keep it.
I:So why do you do it?
R:For money.
I:So does that, I mean, pardon me, but it sounds like you’re saying that you don’t like what you do, because they have a right to their money but then you say, no I have a right to their money and I’m going to take it from them.
R:They have a right to keep their money but I’m going to do it anyways, cause I have no way to get money.  And it’s the easiest way to get money.
I:Why not do something, you know, why not work for money?

I:Have you tried?
R:Yeah.
I:Let’s say you found a job, would you stop doing those things, or not?

I:What do you buy?

How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:good bad right wrong?
I:yeah.
R:bad is something that’s gonna get me arrested and that’s pretty much it. Right and wrong I don’t really understand that.
I:you don’t understand that? What do you mean you don’t understand that?
R:some things that I think are right and shouldn’t be a problem, everybody else thinks are a problem.
I:like what?
R:anything. Smoking weed, that’s a problem, they’ll yell at you for that. Drinking, that’s a problem.

R:if it’s gonna get me in trouble with the police…
I:then it’s wrong and if it doesn’t then it’s right?
R:yep.
I:do you think it’s easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I mean I can decide between right and wrong but I do some things that are wrong as well as some things that are right.
I:okay, but it’s easy for you to tell the difference you just don’t always do the right thing?
R:yeah.
I:do you think deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder over the last two years?
R:easier.
I:why is that?
R:‘cause I know better now. I’m smarter than before.
I:so what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong, you kinda talked about this before.
R:what makes something right or wrong? It depends. I don’t know really what’s right and what’s wrong. I guess I can say I really don’t understand.
I:is it rules or laws, is it the consequences, is it the way you feel, is it what god says?
R:pretty much it’s the consequences of things.
I:so what kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:jail time.
I:anything else?
R:no. no other consequences would really bother me. It’s not as hefty as sitting in jail.
I:not like if somebody gets hurt or somebody gets killed, those things don’t make something wrong?
R:well in some cases. Sometimes people need to get hurt. They do bad things, if nobody, if they’re not doing nothing wrong and somebody just runs up and starts beating them up then that’s wrong.
I:what makes that wrong?
R:‘cause they didn’t do anything. But if the guy that they happen to beat up was somebody that had robbed ‘em or did something that he shouldn’t a done to somebody then it’s right because he shouldn't’a done what he did.
I:so if somebody came and beat up some totally innocent person, why is it wrong? What makes that wrong?
R:because the other person, if they were just minding their business and didn’t even know them, wasn’t affecting their life in any way, they shouldn’t even matter, they should leave them alone and do what they’re doing.
I:do you have a feeling of why that is that people shouldn’t mess with people that aren’t messing with them?
R:‘cause it’s not right!
I:you don’t know? You don’t have a sense of why?
R:that’s pretty much the answer. ‘cause if everyone ran around doing that then shit would be crazy!

How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Good or bad?  I don’t know if there really is a good and bad.  I mean, yeah, there is.  Certain things are bad, I mean inhumane, some things.  But other than that, basically the world is built on corruption so bad - really it’s a fine line.  But right and wrong, I mean wrong?  You’ll go to jail for it.  You’ll get killed over it.

I:Okay.  So what are some of the kind of inhumane things you were talking about that are just wrong?
R:I mean like rape.  People are out here raping people, killing people.  I mean that’s unnecessary.  But other than that like things that people say is bad.  I smoke weed and people say that’s bad.  But it’s like, it’s not that big of a deal really.  It’s not much different than alcohol at all.  Just because they want to say, “Okay, it’s bad.”  I’m saying.  But, no, I don’t think that that’s bad at all.
I:Okay.  So what in your mind is just wrong about rape?  I mean why is that bad?
R:It’s just because it’s a violation.  Nobody should have, you know what I’m saying?  Nobody is in any position to be snatching another person up and doing whatever they want with them.  It’s just not right.
I:Okay.  In general is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy.  Yeah, it’s pretty easy.  I know what I’m gonna get in trouble for, what’s gonna fuck my life up if I do it.  So I pretty much stay away from stuff like that.
I:Okay.  Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:Easier, a lot easier.
I:Okay.  Why?
R:Just being in jail, just knowing the consequences makes it a lot easier.

I:How long were you in jail?
R:Just a few months.  But -
I:Do you mind telling me what for?

I was on probation, and when you’re on probation if you get arrested again it’s a violation of your probation and they can keep you in jail with no bond.  So I couldn’t even bond out of jail.  I had people, my family was there, like, “How much is his bond?”  My bond was $50,000 cash.  And I was in there for disorderly conduct.
I:So what did they say you did?  Just -
R:Disorderly conduct.
I:Okay.  So have your views of what’s right and wrong changed in the past two years?

I:In what ways?

R:Right.
I:Okay, from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Where have I acquired my moral views?  Basically from my dad.  You know, I could have been doing a lot worse.

R:Yeah it’s wrong.

R:About doing something wrong, how do I feel about it?
I:Yeah, uh-huh…

I:Okay, and do you feel like as you get older, that deciding what’s right or wrong gets easier or harder?
R:Harder.
I:Harder, okay, any reasons?
R:Because when you’re older you have more experience and you’re aware of more things so there’s a lot of things that come into play when deciding what’s right and what’s wrong, because you also have to like negotiate or balance or even compare things to see if it’s right or not.

R:Um, mostly from my, my church values, a lot of it comes from there.  And like I can’t drink coffee, you know, ah, or caffeine and that kind of stuff or you know we don’t drink, we don’t smoke, but um, as determining on a daily basis what’s right and wrong, I take from my church values and then what I believe is right and wrong and is immediately, you know, right or immediately wrong, you know, so, I guess that’s how I determine.
I:Where do you think your beliefs about right and wrong come from?
R:My parents and my religion.
I:Okay.  In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Pretty easy .  But um, you know, like I have a sister is not really, she doesn’t really go to our church anymore and she does things that we don’t believe in, you know, so it’s really pretty easy for me to see what’s right and wrong cause I just look at her life, and I’m like okay, that’s not what I’m supposed to do and so I just, you know, so it’s actually, I mean it’s not a good thing but it’s, it actually kind of is sometimes because I have that bad example, so I can see, you know.
I:Yeah.  Do you worry about her?
R:Yes.  A lot.  Yeah.
I:Does she live around here, then?
R:Yeah.  Yeah, she, um, is just, it’s hard because sometimes she ah, I, I kind of act older than her except for she’s older than me and so I’ve been worrying about her ever since we were kids and so it’s like, I kinda wish I could stop taking care of her, but I can’t really, so.
I:Yeah.  Why do you think she believes differently?
R:I think that she is just openly defiant against my Mom, I think my Mom kind of pushed her a little too hard sometimes and so she’s, went completely the other way.  I’m not saying it’s my Mom’s fault or anything, I think my Mom was doing the right thing with her because she’s always been really just experiment-ive  and always wanted to see what the wrong thing was, ever since she was a kid, she’d always do the wrong thing, so.
I:Okay.  What about the past couple years, do you think it’s gotten easier or more difficult to decide about what’s right or wrong?
R:More difficult.  Because as you get older, you think you have more freedom and so you’re like, oh, I could do that, and then you’re like wait a second, that’s not what I would do a couple years ago, or, you know that’s not really my beliefs and then you kind of stop yourself and be careful what you do.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:What was the question?
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, based on your beliefs and just kind of the gut feeling you get, you know.  I mean, I base a lot on that, like how I feel, when I’m about to make that decision, I guess.  And just think, you know, if, if my Mom was standing right next to me, would she be approving of what I’m doing or not, so.  That sort of thing.
I:Okay, so you keep talking about your beliefs and basing what you do on your beliefs, where do you think those beliefs come from, they just kind of come from nowhere and so you’re supposed to do what they say?  Or what’s the reasoning in mind for why you would follow those?
R:No, um, well cause like in my religion we have prophets, so based on what they say, what the scriptures say, what God’s revelation has given to us, um, and then what my parents think you know, right or wrong, there’s not, you know, there’s not certain definite things like should you drink herbal tea, you know, like we don’t know whether we should or not, but my parents think it’s fine, so then I do.  That kind of, so it’s just that kind of stuff, there’s the little pinpoint things that then I go with what my parents have decided on, when it’s the little things that maybe it doesn’t say in the Bible or something like that but when my parents have put a rule, you shouldn’t wear black um, black nail polish, you know, I want you to only get like, we’re only supposed to get one piercing, but you know it’s not set in stone so my parents, I don’t want you to get another piercing or a tattoo, you know, so that kind of stuff is, so I just base it off what my parents tell me.
I:Okay.  Why do you think it’s a good thing to follow what your parents say or what the church says?
R:Because I want to spend the rest of my life with them, in my life, you know I want them there, when I get married and when I have kids and stuff like that so it’s like, if I wanted to have a good relationship then I kinda wanna do what pleases them and what will make me happy.
I:Okay.  So do you think there are any actions that are always wrong?
R:Any actions that are always wrong?  Like, like what?  Like, like?  Like drugs or drink, yeah, drugs, drinking, having sex before you’re married.

R:Hurting people for no apparent reason.
I:Okay, but if there’s a good reason it’s okay?
R:If it’s gonna save more people, I think so.
I:So, what, what, what’s a good enough reason to hurt, like you saying how, the war will hurt people but it will save more people in the end, so, you think that’s, that’s obviously to you a good enough reason to hurt people, but what, what would be, what makes something a good enough reason.
R:Not a good enough reason?
I:Well, maybe you can give me an example of something that’s not a good enough reason to hurt someone, and then what would be a good enough reason?
R:Oh, well not a good enough reason would be shooting someone just so you can take the car.
I:Okay, so, and what would be, so where, how, at what point does hurting somebody become okay?
R:When you’re hurting someone so they stop hurting another person.
I:Okay, so if they’re hurting somebody else it’s okay.
R:Right, like Ward Weaver, right over there, he’s gonna die eventually, you know, and that’s okay because he hurt other people, I mean, to take someone like that away.
I:Right.  But, does somebody have to be hurting other people in order to justify hurting them?
R:I think so.
I:So that’s sort of, that would be how you would decide whether something was, whether it was okay to hurt somebody.
R:Right.
I:If they were hurting somebody else.  Okay.  Where do you think your own views of right and wrong come from?
R:Um, what I’ve been told.
I:By who?
R:My parents.
I:Okay, so is that the main place where it comes from is your parents?
R:And other influences around, like my brothers and sisters and things.
I:Where do you think it comes from, I mean, where do you think your parents figured out what was right and wrong?
R:From their parents, I guess.
I:From their parents.
R:Yeah.
I:So, have you thought about where, where it, where the right and wrong comes from?
R:Just from what people believe.
I:From what people believe.  Just down through history.  What, so is it okay, like if your parents say one thing’s right and somebody else’s parents say it’s, or your parents tell you something’s wrong and someone else’s parents tells them it’s right, how do you decide which is the case, or is it?
R:What I really think.
I:Is it okay for you to think something’s wrong and somebody else to think it’s right?
R:Yeah.
I:That’s okay with you, that doesn’t bother you?
R:Not at all.
I:So if somebody said, it’s okay to hurt somebody even if they’re not hurting anyone else, would you agree or disagree?
R:Just as long as they’re not doing it to anyone I know.  Or me.  If I don’t see it, then, out of sight out of mind.
I:Okay.  So, how do you decide what’s good and bad in life?
R:Um  it’s just kind of a feeling you get, you know, you can tell if it’s right or wrong.
I:Okay.  Can you give me any examples of a time where you’ve had to decide whether something was right or wrong and how you figured it out?
R:Um, kinda, like  I took money from my Mom once.  And you know, I knew it was wrong, but I did it anyway cause I wanted to buy a firecracker for my friend, so.
I:Why was that wrong?
R:Because it’s taking things from my Mom for no better good except for my own personal enjoyment.
I:Okay, so, someone’s own personal enjoyment isn’t a good enough reason to do something.
R:I don’t think so.
I:And so you knew it, you could just tell it was wrong, based on how you felt?
R:Yeah.
I:And, let’s see here.  But what made those things wrong?  Do you think they were wrong?
R:I think that burning down the garbage can was.
I:Okay.
R:And I think that the selling of the mushrooms could have potentially been wrong, but the only wrong it’s considered wrong is because it’s against the law to buy what somebody said.  If it would have possibly harmed the kid, his name is Martin, then it would have been wrong.
I:But because it didn’t harm the kid, do you think it was wrong?
R:I think it could have potentially been wrong, but it ended up not harming him, so.
I:So, something would be wrong, in that, that sounds like the consequences have something to do with whether something’s wrong or not?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  So, if it was, if it wasn’t against the law and it wouldn’t have hurt him, it wouldn’t have been wrong.
R:I don’t think so.
I:Okay, what if something, so if something’s against the law, does that make it wrong?
R:Well, it matters on what it is, like murder, I think that’s wrong, unless the motive is something like, you know, hurting other innocent people.  But, um…
I:But what do you think, does the law always make some, if it’s against the law does that always make it wrong?
R:In my opinion, no, no.
I:No.  So, there’s something outside the law that determines whether it’s right or wrong.
R:Yeah.
I:Okay.  Just being against the law is that enough to make something right or wrong?
R:Not in my opinion.","I say that’s wrong because really you wouldn’t need all the money in the cash register, if you need you know, something small, or and also because it harms the clerk and takes a lot of money away from the clerk and the business.

I:And would you say deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder over the past couple of years?
R:I guess easier because you just have more life experience.

I:Oh, no, no, no, it’s fine, I’m not trying to make you feel ignorant.
R:No, no, no, I’m not saying, no, it’s just like realizing this about myself, like now, I’m like am I just like wandering around with my life or what?  ‘Cause it’s just hard to think of specific events because it’s just so instinctual, I guess.
I:Sure, ok.  That’s fair enough.

I:No just for you, I’m not saying sort of more generally but I mean, how do you… I mean you already touched on this a little bit, saying you sort of learn by experiencing what happens.
R:Yeah.  I think, I don’t know.  ‘Cause I just, I don’t know, the words right and wrong, there’s, to me like, ok say if I just got up and slapped you in the face or something.

I:Um, do you, so a lot of people think it’s wrong to kill somebody without a good reason, do you agree with that?

I:But why is that?
R:Because you’re just taking away someone’s life, someone’s, whatever they want to do, freedom, basically.

R:It’s, some, something that shouldn’t be taken away because unless for like, I don’t know, they killed someone else and something.

I:So what you’re saying is there’s something wrong with taking someone’s life, intrinsically, like in and of itself wrong?
R:Uh-huh (yes).
I:And, and what is that, that’s, why is it in and of itself?  I mean there have been dictators that have killed millions of people and they didn’t think anything was wrong with that.
R:Well they don’t have the views, they just think every—cause they’re the dictator that they can set the laws up how they want it.  And that they’re not physically killing them, they’re sending out their troops or whatever.
I:But they’re responsible.
R:Yeah, they’re responsible.
I:So then you would say the dictator is morally wrong?
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Okay.  What about um, what about if you came across a wallet on the sidewalk and picked it up and there was a lot of money in it and nobody saw you get it, do you think that it would be wrong to keep it instead of returning it to the owner?
R:Yeah.
I:Or just keep it?
R:I, it goes both ways, I mean, like I’d want the money, I’d want to keep it, but then I’d feel guilty because someone might really need that money, and—
I:What if you feel, but is it, should, is it mor—is it, is it, is it the right thing in and of itself to return it, regardless of who needed it, or what if, maybe you needed it more than they do?
R:It would still be wrong because you’re taking something from someone, even though they left it where it could have been taken.
I:And what makes it wrong?
R:That someone doesn’t know that it’s lost, or they don’t know where it is and you’re just sort of picking it off of them and keeping it.

I:From the home?  Okay.
R:From the home.  Because it depends on how you were brought up.  ""Not that."" ""That is wrong."" ""It's right.""  Parents themselves instill this on kids.
I:Yes, and you and your parents...?
R:My mother brought me up well.  I mean, when sometimes... I told my mom about the hooky party and she told me:  ""No, not that.  Don't even think about going"".  I told my father and: ""NO, NOT THAT""  My father because that is his way of talking, loud, right?
I:Yes, yes.
R:Then they advise me on the right way.  ""There are two ways"", they tell me, ""there is a narrow one and a wide one"".  People choose to enter the narrow one, and many go on the wide one.  Because it's wide and all those who to discotheques and liquor go there.  There you go faster because it is easier. But on the narrow way...
I:Uh-huh.
R:... there are few people that go there or are used to going there... because it is the people who try hard, right? that push ahead.  Whereas here, no, here they prefer drugs and they see this way as easier than the other one.
I:The other is more difficult.
R:Yes.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Eh...  The way that... the thing I'm doing, right?  I see it is right or wrong...
I:Uh-huh.
R:That it will lead me to something good, or it will lead me to something bad.  What are the consequences that can result from doing what isn't right.
I:Ah... And in general... consequences for you, consequences for someone else?  Why is something wrong?
R:For example, to fight here.  The consequences will take me to prison.
I:Uh-huh.
R:I'm going to lose classes.  Maybe I stay in prison as they say that now they consider minors as of age.  At 18 you can go to jail.  Then the consequences will be that I will not be able to study any more.  I will stay there, in jail.  And, what will my future be?  Nothing, I have no future.
I:Then, when you are thinking on whether something is wrong or right, do you think about the consequences?
R:Yes, on the consequences that may come.
I:And do you think about other things as well, or only on the consequences?
R:And... what is left, right?  I stay behind and don't move forward anymore.
I:Uh-huh.  Hmm...  How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right or wrong in life?
R:Eh...
I:In addition to the consequences and others?
R:How do I decide, right?  I decide... by... I look at the examples that people give me and then I decide, right?  People were like this, and they overcame.  Then I have to decide to follow the examples they give me.","How my own view?  To do something? Well, the thoughts depend on the person, right? If the person wants or doesn't want to attack.  That depends on how he or she was brought up as a child, right?  If he or she is aggressive. When I am in a situation... if I fight or don't fight? Yes. Yes. Those thoughts come from the home, right?

R:You got to go with your guts like because if your guts like, “Don’t do it.” You don’t do it because I’ve had times where my mother says, “Don’t do it.” I’ve done it and I got arrested so I just follow my instincts now.

I:Would you say it’s generally easy or hard for you to decide between what’s right and wrong?
R:It usually is pretty easy because usually you know what’s right and wrong. It’s just are you still going to do it or not. So I know what’s right and wrong. It’s just sometimes I do the wrong thing.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier over the past couple of years or harder, would you say?
R:It has gotten a lot easier.
I:Why would you say that?
R:Because my eyes are open more. I see the world, how it’s. So it has just made them kind of decisions easier.
I:Have your views changed over the past couple of years about what’s right and wrong?
R:No. It’s just like because there is that little gray area but to me that gray area has gone littler. There is still stuff in that gray area like if your wife is sick, would you go steal medicine for her if you can’t pay for it? Just stuff like that, I would do. It’s wrong to steal but you got to do what you got to do sometimes.
I:What do you think is it that makes something right or wrong?
R:I don’t know. I could not tell you, just you know what’s right and you know what’s wrong. That’s it.
I:But is it generally, would you say it’s how it made you feel or is it like rules or laws or is it the consequences of what happens?
R:It’s a little bit of all that. It’s like in your heart, you know like say you shoot somebody. You know that’s wrong but you did it. And then like, it’s just stuff like that. You know what’s right and wrong. Like people, “I didn’t know it was wrong.” “Yeah, you did.” They still did it. So now, just pay up.

I:But why is it wrong though?   I mean why is there a fine and a sign that says don’t litter?
R:Cause they don’t’ want to pick up after you.  They don’t’ want to do that.  It’s like put your trash in the garbage can.

R:Oh no, they just ask me have I ever, or you know, but and like we have communication so you know, you know every, like somebody, yeah, they tell me oh Linda, let’s do drugs, let’s do this let’s do that, no, that’s not my thing, you know and somehow some guys or girls they get mad cause like oh Linda doesn’t want to do it and then god damnit, you know, I was like you can’t pressure that person, when until you know it’s a no.  And stop you know bugging about it, you know.

He tells me god, Linda, this is so good and I was like oh, that’s good, enjoy, you know if you want it, you know but that’s not my thing.  He’s like god, you don’t want to enjoy it, come on it’s good, I was like it’s good, you know but when I say no, it’s a no, and sometimes you have to respect that.

So suppose you know some new situation came up that your parents hadn’t talked to you about and you didn’t, you know something you have never faced before, how do you decide if it’s good or bad or right and wrong, what’s your thought process?
R:God, I never thought about it, um, I don't know I mean like if my parents never even, you know thought about it you know like talked to me about you know what’s going on now or that god, I’m in a situation like and the doors and the windows, like what should I do, you know I mean I will talk to them you know tell at least what’s going on, you know that guys never told me, you know talked about it you know like god, like for example, like I was taking health classes, you know at Valley College and they were, they never like they told me about condoms and I was like oh my god, you know.  And I told my parents and they’re like oh, well we never had a really conversation about that, you know.  But when you start getting the conversation you start telling them what’s going on, you know.  It’s like you have an idea.  But I mean like nothing’s going on in my life like you know that they have never, you know, teached me about you know but it’s always what I know now, they already knew about it, you know.  It’s like about school, about sex, anything, you know.  They know about it, you know cause like we have communication.","Of course it’s wrong, I mean like, because, I don't know.  I mean like for me, like the way I think of myself is like god, I know what is right, I know what is wrong, you know about caring, about like saying I care about myself, you know.  A lot of persons will argue in girls, they don’t care about their self.  They’re like god, I don’t like my life, my life’s like this, my life is like oh my god, I can’t stand it, you know my parents are like this with me, you know, but I mean like if you’re, you have communication with certain of your family and you know, every, you know you don’t worry about anything, oh god, like okay, for example, if something goes wrong in your life, you know I mean if you try to get help from other people, they’ll help you out, you know.  Just you know keep going on school, keep you know doing your thing, you know. But I mean like if you get pregnant, that’s your thing, you know.  I mean somehow they do keep going to school, graduating, you know they think oh you know what, I’m gonna do this for my child, you know but some girls don’t care.  They’re like oh, the door’s closed to me, they’re like oh god, I can’t do this no more, I, you know. I guess my parents, my parents. My parents just there for me and they just tell me what’s right, what’s wrong.  Ditching of course is not my thing, you know. Oh no, they just ask me have I ever, or you know, but and like we have communication so you know, you know every, like somebody, yeah, they tell me oh Linda, let’s do drugs, let’s do this let’s do that, no, that’s not my thing, you know and somehow some guys or girls they get mad cause like oh Linda doesn’t want to do it and then god damnit, you know, I was like you can’t pressure that person, when until you know it’s a no.  And stop you know bugging about it, you know.  And once like I told one of this guy that I knew for a while and then I never thought I was like god, I thought he was gonna be a professional like going to school and all that stuff, now it’s just, he’s just working at a McDonalds and doing drugs, you know.  He tells me god, Linda, this is so good and I was like oh, that’s good, enjoy, you know if you want it, you know but that’s not my thing.  He’s like god, you don’t want to enjoy it, come on it’s good, I was like it’s good, you know but when I say no, it’s a no, and sometimes you have to respect that.

R:Gut feeling, conscience.  I mean my dad used to always tell me if you know what’s right, do what’s right.
I:How do you know what’s right?
R:(sighs) I just, I mean, I just have, everyone has I think a gut feeling where it’s like you know if you’re doing something wrong.  Like true when you’re an infant it might not be, but when you’re a grown up you have a sense about you, to that point where you know, if you steal something you know that’s wrong, if you hurt someone you know that’s wrong, so, I mean that’s usually.
I:Let me object here.  Lots of people are stealing.
R:Yeah.
I:Is that wrong?
R:We actually just talked about this today in school in my ethics class.  Um, yes, in theory it’s wrong to steal, but I mean what I said was, you have stores and grocery shops with food and stuff right?  The food is going to go spoil if nobody takes it, and the clothes are probably ruined,
I:Why would you steal ruined clothes?
R:Well I mean, we were watching a video clips, and this girl has shoes, and this guy goes you know that’s wrong, right?  And the girl goes yeah, but we’re going to be walking and we don’t need things cutting our feet when we walk.  And it’s like they have a need for something, I mean it’s like yeah, it’s wrong but it’s kind of hard you know?  It’s like, you kind of feel for them, it’s to the point where yeah, it’s wrong, but it’s like they need certain things to survive.  They need food, they need water,
I:Ten shirts?
R:What?
I:Ten shirts?
R:Maybe they have a big family.
I:Three pairs of shoes?
R:Well it’s like this one guy, he walked out with a big TV, you know, it’s like that, that’s wrong.
I:Why?
R:You don’t need a TV to survive through a big hurricane, you need food, clothes.
I:Okay.
R:Yes, I’m sure.  Yes a lot of people are stealing and most of them are doing it out of necessity but I’m sure some of them are doing it to hoard stuff, but,
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Um, I don’t know, I mean.
I:For you.
R:For me?  I don’t think it’s gotten easier or harder, I think it’s just stayed the same.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Oooh, uh, uh, (pause) I don’t know how to answer that.
I:Okay.  Does something being against the law make it wrong or not necessarily?
R:Um, yeah, I mean.
I:Like you have school rules I’m assuming.
R:Yeah.
I:If you break a school rule, have you done wrong or have you just break a school rule?  Are they arbitrary?  Do you just have to put up with them?
R:The rules?  No, you break rules you can get in deep, we have things called reprimands, kind of like demerits and if you get 5 of them, then you have to pay $5.  But uh,
I:Is it wrong to break school rules or is it just you’ll pay the price if you do?
R:I think most people at my school would say if you break a school rule then it’s wrong, oh well.  I guess.
I:Okay.
R:Some of these questions are kind of hard to answer.
I:Alright.  Is what God says, does that make something right or wrong?
R:Um, yeah, I mean, yeah.
I:What if God says one thing but the law, or the norm, sort of the way people act in a place is another thing?
R:Well as far as how other people act, it’s you know, that’s how they’re acting, just cause that’s how their acting it doesn’t make it right.  As far as the law of the land, it says that we’re supposed to follow the law, the bible says that we’re supposed to follow the law of Caesar, but you don’t have to follow that, but you also have to follow the law of God, so.

Now, how do you normally decide what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I don’t know.  My dad used to always, I guess the best way to describe it, my dad used to always say, ‘Quinn* if you know what’s right, do right,’ because I feel like most people, you know, people have a general conception of what is right and wrong.  You know that if you’re hurting someone, that’s bad.  And if you’re, if it’s, if you’re physically or, you know, emotionally hurting someone that’s usually a bad thing.  Like, that’s usually how I do it.  It’s like people, in my opinion, I think that they have a basic knowledge of what is right and wrong.
I:So is it generally easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s like, if I know I’m doing something illegal, or against the law, or wrong, I know.  And if I do it, it’s because I know I’m doing it.
I:Over the past couple years, has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder?
R:It’s been a little bit more clear for me.
I:What’s right and wrong?
R:Yeah, it’s been like, like I’ve always known what’s right and wrong but now it’s more or less like, I know this is right, I know this is wrong and I usually stay away from doing the wrong thing because it’s like that’s not beneficial to me.  Like I used to steal a lot, and, for instance I got caught stealing and so now I don’t steal anymore because it’s like although, like, my opinions on stealing and stuff may be different, I’m not going to do it anymore because I can’t afford tickets and it’s bad for me.  So it’s like I know, it’s kind of like more or less like I don’t know.
I:Sure.  Have your views changed in the past couple of years, like of what’s right and wrong, or pretty much stayed the same?
R:Yes and no.  I’m, I feel like on some things like, I used to think that, you know, like you shouldn’t have sex until you’re married.  And that was wrong if you had sex before you were married.  That’s changed, like I don’t feel like you literally have to be married to do that.  Like, if you love the person, wholeheartedly 100%, then I don’t feel like that’s a bad thing.  Like just like one example.
I:Alright. What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Usually it’s based off of if it’s hurting someone I don’t need to be doing it.  So, an instance like drugs, that’s been hurting my mom, that’s my relationships with my friends, so I’m not going to do that anymore.  Same with drinking.  That was hurting me, like it was bad.  I went on a year long alcoholic streak where I was drinking heavily every night.  It’s like, I don’t need that, I just need to be able to be clear in my head so I can know what I’m doing.
I:Do you feel it’s like the consequences or something else?
R:I don’t know.  There’s a, like I said, usually like inside I can feel whether or not this is good or bad, and like when I was drinking and doing drugs, like I knew inside that I shouldn’t be doing this.
I:So it’s not just consequences.
R:Right.  Like consequences, I mean, I, people have told me I have a really high tolerance for pain, whether it be physical pain, like emotional pain, or whatever like I can handle it, so I don’t really know if it would be like consequences because like I said, I can, like tickets and stuff like that, it’s kind of like, ‘it’s money, I’ll get it, it’s whatever.’  So it’s more or less a feeling and sense of this isn’t good and I shouldn’t be doing it.
I:In your view where do those feelings come from?
R:Most of it’s from, I would feel like my upbringing.  Like what my dad always told me as a kid, ‘if you know what’s right do right.’ If you know what’s wrong, you know. So just do it. Others might be, I guess they could be tied in religiously that like I feel like what I’m doing isn’t good for me, like, more or less like spiritually, I guess you could say.  I guess it’s a little bit of both.
I:And where do you think you acquired your moral views from, I mean as they were changing?
R:Like I said when I was younger I got my moral views from my parents. Whenever I went through that whole like anti-establishment thing that was more or less a, like a searching out of what I felt was, I’m still like searching for what I believe and stuff like that, but at that point I was, you know, it’s just, the last 2 of those were more or less just myself, you know, wondering and searching for what I thought was right and wrong.  I guess they were more like self-taught about what, self morals.","I don’t know.

I:Um, but how would you convince somebody if they didn’t think that it was wrong?  What would you say?
R:(pause) If somebody believed lying, it didn’t matter, I would kind of reverse it back to them, like if people lied to you what would you do? Maybe.
I:Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, um, and so, where do your own views of right and wrong come from? I mean you have views that some things are right and some things are wrong and everyone should know that
R:Yeah.
I:Um, and if they said how do you know that, would you say, well,
R:Family and religion.
I:Okay.  Um, and okay, so it’s grounded in family and religion, there’s nothing, um, there’s really no way to describe it to someone.  If they want to know what’s right or wrong um, they should kind of go to the family traditions or go to their church or whatever and learn it.  Or is there something else that makes something right?
R:Conscience.
I:Conscience?  Okay.  So you know it, people know it.  It’s kind of individuals know what’s right and wrong, they’re kind of born that way?
R:Yeah.  Kind of innate.
I:Okay.  So, yeah.  So it’s innate.  So and um, let’s see then, just to follow up then, if you have to decide what’s good and bad or right and wrong in life, then you look to your family and you look to your religion, and perhaps there’s a conscience as well?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay, do you have any examples of that where you were struggling with a right and wrong and you uh,
R:Like if I knew a group was doing something, would I want to go over and do it with them, like that?
I:Yeah, oh that’s an example?  Yeah.
R:I would just kind of go somewhere else.
I:So um, so but you haven’t had, like have you had circumstances where say you needed to know, or you wanted to know for yourself, is it right or wrong to go off with this group.  Maybe they were doing drugs or whatever and you had to make this decision and you said to yourself what does my family believe, what does my church believe that sort of thing.
R:What would they think of me.
I:Oh okay.  So you mean what would your family and what would your church think of me.
R:Yeah, what would they, kind of like, (pause), okay let’s go back to the thing.  If I saw a group that was, if I was with a group and they started cursing or drinking or smoking or something, I would walk away.

R:No, because you know, there’s just some stuff that are different, but if it helps someone else it’s kinda good, but if it’s like, it helps a whole group of people but it doesn’t hurt anyone, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone, any animal, anything like that, that’s kind of what makes it right or wrong.

Um, how do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Um, how it affects people.
I:Okay.
R:And, general knowledge, like would this hurt people, would it help people and is it morally right or wrong.
I:Okay, so do you think, is it in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong, or do you sometimes have a hard time deciding what’s right or wrong?
R:It’s easy for me.
I:Has it gotten harder or easier in the last couple of years for you to distinguish between what’s right and what’s wrong?
R:Um, probably, they’re probably, it’s just more, it’s more different weight, where I have to decide what’s right and wrong.  Like in the past, it was you know, is it right to skip out on chores, now it’s more is it right to go over to my friends house when my parents think I’m at like school uh, uh, park or something .
I:Okay.  And so, what is it that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, again it’s just like morally right, I don’t want to do anything that would hurt anybody.
I:Okay so basically just the consequences of something determines whether something is right or wrong?
R:Right.
I:Anything else that might, when you say morally, what do you mean by that?
R:Um, sometimes society might be wrong
I:Okay.
R:It’s more like, it’s hard to explain, like what is truly right, um, for instance like, I don’t believe in the death penalty
I:Okay.
R:Because morally I just think that we shouldn’t be deciding who lives and who dies.  Cause I don’t know, I just think it’s wrong, and eye for an eye kind of thing, type of deal
I:Right.
R:And that’s the other way I decide if something’s right or wrong.  And um, is what I’m doing going to like, if it’s doing something because of something, is it, if it’s sort of, if it’s something against something else then it’s like, the punishment fitting the crime sort of deal, but if it’s with the situation, is what I’m doing going to be okay with what just happened.
I:Okay and is there any particular standard of right or wrong that you follow or is it just each situation you kind of just figure out what’s right and wrong?
R:Each situation is different.
I:Okay. Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Um, now, I wouldn’t say that something is completely wrong, there can always be an alternative to something.  That would, I mean, like killing for instance, although I don’t believe in the death penalty, I think if someone is an immediate threat to a, like if someone is in jail and you don’t have them or anything and somewhere where they are an immediate threat to a lot of people, you might tell them, that I would render them unconscious, and take them
I:Right.
R:But I can see why someone would think that they had to kill them,
I:Emergency stand off or something like that?
R:Right, I’m thinking that big political picture or something like that.
I:Right.
R:Like if someone had a weapon of mass destruction or something you know, and they were about to push the button,
I:Right.
R:Shoot them.
I:Right.
R:I couldn’t shoot them, but someone else could shoot them.
I:Right, so in other words, killing someone is not always wrong, cause there are circumstances where it could be justified.
R:Well the other thing is that you shouldn’t murder a person, but you maybe, murder is different from killing.
I:Okay.
R:Like for instance the ten commandments the actual translation is thou shall not murder, not thou shall not kill.
I:Right.  Okay.
R:So.
I:And so, sort of a difference of intent and reason behind it.
R:Right.
I:Okay, and um, from where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Um, some from church, some from my family.  Um situations that I’ve seen, and things like that.  Like seeing my friends and what happens to them, and like seeing what’s right.","Um, how it affects people.

R:I look at if it’s going to hurt someone, then obviously that’s bad.  And I look at, basically I rely on my own morals and I look at the situation and every individual situation and I try to figure out, you know, what, what is good, what is bad, and then beyond that because something that is bad, this is going to sound really twisted, but something that is bad can still be better for society, if you would, like you know killing a mass-murdered.  I don’t agree that we, that there should be capital punishment, but then I see it as a societal necessity that you know, so I kind of look at it on two different levels, like morally is it right or wrong and then for general for like most amount of people, does it, is it good for them or bad for them, so.
I:In general, do you think that it is easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:If presented with all the information, I think it’s pretty easy for me to look through.  In general I’ll discuss it with someone who I think knows a lot about what’s going on and that’s anything from drama with friends to how I'm going to vote on a measure.  I discuss with my dad a lot about the recent measures that we voted on here in Oregon.  I think it’s pretty easy if you’re presented with all the information.  I wish more people would take the time to stop and look at all the different aspects of something before they made that initial, this is what we’ll do!
I:Do you think that as you’ve gotten older that it’s become easier or harder for you to make those types of decisions?
R:I think it’s become harder, but I think my decisions have been better.  So you know, as a kid you can make the decision real quick, this is good, this is bad.  But then, you know, I think the little bit more difficulty for looking at something from different angles gives me a better perspective and a better decision-making process.
I:What do you think it is that makes something either right or wrong, like what’s the actual?
R:I think mostly it has to do with whether it works for the, the benefit or if it hurts, you know, people or an animal if it’s that situation or you know, whatever.  If it does, if its results are beneficial or not or I don’t know, then how do you judge whether it’s good or bad?  I don’t know, I think it can change from person to person, you know?  Like if you go back to the capital punishment argument that will be argued for centuries, and has been argued for centuries, to the mother of that person, you know, that you’re doing harm; to that person you’re doing harm, to society you’re doing good.  Well you’re hurting on person; does that outweigh doing good for a lot of people?

R:Cause eventually you will get caught (giggles).
I:Right, so do you think, uh, you said that you think there are some morals that apply to everybody?  Where, who decides what those are or who decides where those come from?  Or do you have any idea?
R:Um, I don’t really know.  Cause, I mean, some parents they know their kids smoke pot and stuff like that.  So they’re fine, it’s not a big moral thing for them cause their parents are like whatever.  But then some parents are really high into morals, like don’t smoke pot, don’t drink, don’t do this, and, I kind of think it comes from your parents.
I:Okay.

R:The basic criteria?
I:What’s the ultimate standard, you know, if it’s not necessarily parents, is there something above parents that makes something right or wrong or is it just what your parents say?

R:Um, it, first it was because you know your parents said it was right or wrong, but then you kind of come into my own, saying no, this is what I really need to do and I don’t want to do it.  So probably just what I came up with my parents and what they instilled in me, morals and stuff.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Um, in general it’s easy to decide, it’s harder to do it.
I:Okay.   Why do you think that is?
R:Cause usually the right thing is something, is not the easiest kind of.  So it takes more guts to stand up and actually do it.
I:Okay, so do you think deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Um, it’s gotten easier cause I’ve gotten to know more myself more, just knowing what’s actually right and wrong, cause I can talk myself into things really easy.  So I think it’s gotten easier.
I:Okay, any particular reasons why?
R:Um, probably cause I know what I need to do, now it’s not like, well nobody will find out and you don’t need to do this, cause if someone does find out you’ll be in trouble.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, huh, that’s a tricky one.  Um, well the law you know is right and wrong but it’s just, it, I guess it’s just personal cause you know some people believe it’s okay to live together you know before marriage, sorry, do you live together?
I:Oh, no, it’s okay
R:But then others are completely, I don’t know I guess it’s just, what was the question again, I’m sorry I was just thinking about that.
I:No, just about what makes something right or wrong.
R:Oh, um probably just your beliefs and your religion, beliefs and stuff like that.
I:Okay.  Um, so who or what do you think has the power or authority to determine what’s right and wrong?
R:Um, I would like to say from like the Bible, cause it all comes from, it all comes from God eventually, so as long as you get your rules from the Bible then you’re good.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not really?
R:Oh, I think like lying and cheating and like murder and all that stuff is completely wrong, no matter what you do.  I mean people talk themselves out of like little lies and stuff like that, but you know, if you have to lie, you shouldn’t be doing that.
I:Okay.  So can you tell me from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Um, from my parents.
I:Okay.  Where do you think that they got their views?
R:Um, my mom got hers from her family.  But my dad got his from anti-his family.  Cause his family is really messed up.  So whatever he saw, he kind of did the opposite of, so that’s where he got his.","Um, it, first it was because you know your parents said it was right or wrong, but then you kind of come into my own, saying no, this is what I really need to do and I don’t want to do it.  So probably just what I came up with my parents and what they instilled in me, morals and stuff. Um, in general it’s easy to decide, it’s harder to do it. Cause usually the right thing is something, is not the easiest kind of.  So it takes more guts to stand up and actually do it. Um, it’s gotten easier cause I’ve gotten to know more myself more, just knowing what’s actually right and wrong, cause I can talk myself into things really easy.  So I think it’s gotten easier. Um, probably cause I know what I need to do, now it’s not like, well nobody will find out and you don’t need to do this, cause if someone does find out you’ll be in trouble.  Um, huh, that’s a tricky one.  Um, well the law you know is right and wrong but it’s just, it, I guess it’s just personal cause you know some people believe it’s okay to live together you know before marriage, sorry, do you live together? But then others are completely, I don’t know I guess it’s just, what was the question again, I’m sorry I was just thinking about that. Oh, um probably just your beliefs and your religion, beliefs and stuff like that. Um, I would like to say from like the Bible, cause it all comes from, it all comes from God eventually, so as long as you get your rules from the Bible then you’re good.

R:probably based on the value system that my parents instilled in me, I mean if I have questions about things I’ll bounce it off of them. But in my gut I kind of know what they’re going to say.
I:so it’s like based on things that you were taught?
R:Yeah. Mmhmm. My mom’s very black and white with certain things so it was a tough age, she’s a tough love kind of woman.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide what is right and wrong?
R:In general, it’s easy. Sometime’s you know what’s right but you’ll get a gain somewhere else if you kind of use a grey area sort of thing.  But in my gut I know it’s right and wrong.
I:Do you think that right and wrong has gotten easier in the last two years?
R:I think it has.  Because I’m not afraid to tell people that I’m not going ot do something because I think it’s wrong, it’s made me more comfortable not to be like  ‘oh they’re not gonna like me.’ And I’m not gonna move to the cliques anymore. Things kind of like that.
I:Do you think when you were younger it was just harder to be sure?
R:Definitely harder to be sure.  Especially in college where you have these kind of clique-y sort of things and once you’re in a group and like you know you have to stay popular in that group.  It was really hard to say no to certain things then because I just didn’t want to be excommunicated.
I:so what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I guess that would depend on… hmm… I think that someone when you’re talking about if you can say it to their face or if it’s something that can be published in the front page of the newspaper and you’re not ashamed of it.
I:So it’s kind of consequences or …
R:It’s they’re open, if  it’s something you would do in or something you would you’re not ashamed that everyone else would know.  That it’s something like, I wouldn’t want this person to know,  I don’t want a lot of people to know that I’m doing this.  Then it’s something you shouldn’t be doing.
I:so where do you think you acquired your moral views?
R:More from my mom than my dad.  Probably both, but more my mom’s side.
I:And have your views about what’s right and wrong changed in the past three years.
R:Probably more strong and more things that I’m willing to step up and say.  I  think you have to keep forming your ideas and what’s right what’s wrong and once you get up to it all you have to be the one to sort of sit through, because your parents aren’t there to do all the dragging for you.
I:Do you think it’s like a growing up thing?
R:Oh definitely.","probably based on the value system that my parents instilled in me, I mean if I have questions about things I’ll bounce it off of them.

Is all, that’s all I can think of it, I’m don’t know, I’m not really sure. Um, I think, I think it’s wrong to like lie and steal, um, I think it’s wrong to to like fight, argue with your parents and stuff like to to think you’re you know better than they do cuz God put them in your life to govern over you and they know better than I do and stuff like that, and to kill and all that. Um, I think I think there are occasion when it’s okay or steal like for your country or like if if there’s like a specific reason, I don’t know.  Yeah, I think there are cases where it’s fine. Um, I think I think if it um, I think if I prayed and stuff and I just really felt like that this was something that was okay that, that just, just for this specific time that it would be okay, God want it, it was fine with God, and that, if it, like, was, would benefit like my family or something like that then that would be okay.

R:basically from what first of all from what probably my parents have taught me I feel like that they pretty much give me a good sense of what is right and wrong and everything and they uh, they kinda learned that and teach me from our religion or whatever, like going to church services and stuff like that, so I feel like by going with them to services and everything, I feel like that’s probably how I’ve learned best about what’s right and wrong.
I:would you say in general it’s easy or hard for you to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:I think it’s pretty easy for me, I think that my parents did a good job teaching me and everything, so
I:do you think it’s gotten easier or harder in the past couple of years to decide?
R:I actually think it’s gotten easier, I kinda feel like when I was in the past few years, like the awkward teenage years, you’re kinda more likely to follow the crowd or whatever, but I feel like now, I don’t really care what people think and I’d be more likely to do what I know is right.
I:so has there been any kind of change in how you think about right and wrong in the past couple of years?
R:not much, I still think it’s just about the same, I think I probably have just learned more with age or whatever, but yeah.
I:and what do you think actually makes something right or wrong?
R:hm, I would say, well a lot of things that I think are right or wrong are kind of have kind of already been pointed out through religion and reading the Bible and everything, I kinda feel like that’s kinda given me the basis or whatever.  But I think pretty much anything that I know, anything that’s against the law or anything like that, that would probably not be a good thing, or just anything that I feel like would cause harm to myself or to any other person or anything like that, I think that’s kinda what keeps me away, gives me a feeling that something’s not right.
I:we talked about your religion and parents influencing your morality, are there any other sources of influence that shape the way you think about these things?
R:I would say definitely my friends, too.   I’ve got some pretty good friends, so, yeah.","basically from what first of all from what probably my parents have taught me I feel like that they pretty much give me a good sense of what is right and wrong and everything and they uh, they kinda learned that and teach me from our religion or whatever, like going to church services and stuff like that, so I feel like by going with them to services and everything, I feel like that’s probably how I’ve learned best about what’s right and wrong.

I:Or um, where did you get those ideas that that’s what makes something wrong?
R:I guess going back to school, there’s, there’s stuff that you do and the penalty is so small it’s sort of ridiculous, but then there’s other things, they’ll send you home for six weeks or kick you out of the school and,
I:Right.
R:That’s, that’s a really big factor, I guess.
I:So the, so that, in that case, that would be the consequences are what help you decide what’s right, where those ideas come from.

I:Is there anything that would be right to do even if nobody caught you doing it, anything that would be wrong to do if nobody caught you?

I:Uh-huh, so where’d you get your ideas about stealing?
R:Um,  I, I guess it just goes back to like getting what you deserve and if you’re stealing it, you don’t,
I:Okay.

R:um…  I’m not sure, it’s just if I think about it you know I’ll just know.  Cause this is wrong and this is right and I’m not sure how I come to that decision, maybe just the way that I was raised or you know normally I don’t really consult anybody or anything except myself and I usually figure it out and I usually think that I’m right.
I:and in general is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:pretty easy,
I:why?
R:I dunno, like I said, I can usually just tell right away, don’t have to think about it very hard, you just know. It’s hard to describe.
I:no, that’s ok. Has deciding between right and wrong gotten harder over the past two years?
R:I would say it’s probably gotten easier just with experience. I can’t really think of a concrete example of that, but you know I cant think of how it would have gotten any harder.
I:ok have your moral views changed in the past two years?
R:no I don’t think so.
I:and what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I guess I would say I expect other people yeah I think that’s what I think about the most in deciding because I could just do whatever I wanted to do but usually where I stop is where it might still be good for me, but not good for somebody else.
I:so where would it be that you draw the line and hurt other people too much, to say we’ll stop here?
R:I would say it’s like when anyone assumes there’s any kind of negative effect on somebody else I would stop.
I:what would be an example of that?
R:I would go with my speeding ticket, if there were somebody else in the car, I never would be going that fast, you know I was doing it and I knew that it was wrong, but I wanted to get home quickly and when my parents found out about it they kinda made me realize that something did happen that didn’t just affect me or them and that’s when I really started to feel bad about it.
I:why did you know it was wrong at the time?
R:uh
I:what made it wrong?
R:on one hand, you know, I’m driving by signs that say the speed limit and normally that wouldn’t concern me very much because I was going 40 in a 15 I wouldn’t have thought that seriously about it, but going that fast, horrible things can happen is when… there’s probably a reason why they don’t want you to go this fast.
I:ok so what is morally wrong about violating the speed limit?
R:morally wrong I would say you could hurt other people around you and also clarifying that when I was doing this it was Sunday afternoon and there was nobody around so I just thought I’m not gonna hit anybody, it’s a highway there’s nobody crossing the street or anything, so that’s why I would say I didn’t feel morally wrong about it, I mean if I was going through a school zone when they were getting out and going 60 miles an hour when they were just getting out, I would feel morally wrong about it and not do it, but it didn’t really hit me until later when I talked to my parents about it that you know its just probably not smart but not morally the right thing to do.
I:so it’s mostly to your parents that it’s morally wrong?
R:yeah that’s what I mean, if I were to get in an accident or get killed some of my close friends, if I had a girlfriend or anything like that you know I would think about them as well, but mostly my parents, my family, my grandparents.
I:so where have you acquired your moral views? Where do they come from?
R:I’m not sure, if I had to guess it would be my parents and just growing up there were consequences if you did something wrong and I guess I just figured what was wrong and the severity of the punishment, figured out what was really wrong or what was not that bad.

R:I mean something that makes it right or wrong.  I guess it depends on the situation and - I don’t know what makes something right or wrong.
I:Well, you mentioned earlier a consequence.  Is that kinda how you decide, or?
R:Yeah.  Because I wouldn’t do nothing to get me in serious trouble.
I:In legal trouble.
R:Yeah.
I:So what about if something doesn’t really have anything to do with the law?
R:Like?
I:I don’t know, just something that might make you have to make a decision about what is the right thing to do.
R:I’m not really into doing wrong wrong things.
I:Ok. So it basically it comes down to legal and not legal?
R:I mean I’m not really a bad person, so I don’t really do a lot of bad stuff.
I:Okay.  And from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Just growing up.  From - from life itself I guess.
I:M8:So on your own?  Growing up, okay.  So some people believe that it’s sometimes okay to break moral rules if it works to your advantage and you can get away with it.  What do you think about that?","I guess I know what’s gonna get me in trouble and what’s not. Yeah. It could be easy and it could be hard, but I would say it would be more easy. Harder. Because the prices of everything is going up so high. Oh, oh. Trip. Right and wrong, I mean - me getting older. Makes it a lot harder? Like - I guess when you get older you can get in more trouble with - start getting tickets and stuff like that.  I got a ticket last night. He said loud music. I was turning into a parking lot and my speaker box they came undone, and when my speaker box came undone it made a big boom, and he said that it was a loud boom box ticket or something.  They just seem to stop my car like every week, same cop, for something. Just about every week.  That makes it right or wrong? I mean something that makes it right or wrong.  I guess it depends on the situation and - I don’t know what makes something right or wrong. Yeah.  Because I wouldn’t do nothing to get me in serious trouble. Yeah. Like? I’m not really into doing wrong wrong things. I mean I’m not really a bad person, so I don’t really do a lot of bad stuff.  Just growing up.  From - from life itself I guess.","The respondent would put an inheritance in the bank and spend it on necessities and family because it wasn't their money, and they generally determine right from wrong based on the consequences of their actions, influenced by their experiences and the rising costs of living, while also acknowledging a moral responsibility to help others when needed."

R:Um, Ana Mae.
I:Where?
R:Ana Mae.
I:Ana Mae?
R:Yeah.  Pretty much.
I:Explain that.
R:It’s like um, my friends tell me that I’m really good with analogies, and I’m pretty much since Ana Mae’s pretty much work like epics.  Like someone who has an extreme characteristic of the ideal person pretty much. And so it’s like I try to relate some of the situations sometimes and sometimes I can see what’s morally right and what’s morally wrong.   And a lot of Ana Mae’s is pretty much about that.
I:So they’re big morality plays?
R:Yeah.  So if they’re always like is this really the right thing, and that’s really like the common question that they put up there.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Opinion.  Opinion.
I:Tell me what you mean?  Like some individual’s opinion?
R:Yeah.
I:So in the case of your example of Hitler and World War II and that, was even though you say he did something wrong, it came out good for certain parts of that population, was what he did morally right or wrong?
R:Yeah.  It’s just, it depends on your opinion.  Or in that case propaganda. Propaganda, will weight the decision.  Like the Germans at that time were just doing what they thought was right.  They say Germans are evil, da, da, da, da, they thought they were doing the right thing.  They thought that by killing Jews they were helping the better good.  And so,
I:How would you view that like from your perspective in history, like this is 2003 and that was 1930’s, what’s your, how would you view that on a moral basis?
R:Like what?
I:Having access to propaganda and some sides said yeah, and some sides said no, whatever, your perspective in history in 2003 as a 15 year old, living now, having read this stuff and understanding whatever from history, how would you vie it morally, right or wrong, that Hitler offed all these people but it benefited people not just himself?
R:I think he probably could have, it was wrong how he did it.  He probably could have done it a lot less sloppy cause he really didn’t need to do that. He didn’t really need to kill the Jews but since he was a racist he just did that.  But boy he, I mean like he could have like right now, um, they take, they enlist black people, they didn’t enlist minorities first to the army.  He could have done that. He could have enlisted all the Jews into the army and had them fight for his cause.  He could have done that.  He didn’t really need to go that far.
I:Okay if you think that what makes something right or wrong is based on opinion, how do you decide what’s right and wrong in life?
R:Just put it to past experiences and see.  It’s just like, it’s just, I don’t know, it’s hard to explain that.
I:Can you give me an example of maybe sometime when you had to make a decision and then what you based that decision on?
R:Um, like um, like when I first started taking my honors classes they said you won’t be able to handle this class.  But then I figured I just said whatever repercussions happen, whatever, just go along with it.  Um, just go for it.  And then later, um, wanted to ask my girlfriend out.  And I was thinking what if she says no, what if she says yes, just take the repercussions, just go for it.  What the hell, what could you lose, you know.
I:So those are, but, so in any situation where you have to decide if something is morally right or morally wrong, good or bad, would you be the same sort of thing you would just sort of, you pool information and you said, okay I’m going for it, no matter what and I’ll stand up to the repercussions?
R:Yeah, pretty much just, cause like, it’s pretty much just like whatever I feel is right.  Because my opinion is based on my personality.  And my personality is affected by my experiences.  So I just take it as whatever I feel is right or wrong, is just based on those experiences.  So I take it for granted that it’s already, the facts have already been analyzed as some other thing.
I:Okay, so, and I’m not trying to gun you here, I’m just trying to make you articulate what you mean, so I understand it.  Are there limits to what you would and wouldn’t do morally?  Um, would you cheat, would you hurt somebody, would you lie?  Would you lie, cheat and steal?
R:Pretty much all three.
I:What would be your deciding factor in whether you would lie or cheat or steal.  Would there be some situations where you wouldn't?
R:Um, yeah there would be some situations,
I:Such as what do you think?
R:I don't know, probably, like I said, things, the opinion of right or wrong is motivated by greed, so I would probably steal if it’s like something, like if someone left a Game Cube, like I was at Target or something and only my friend was there and he was a security guard and he turned off all the cameras or something I’d probably walk out with a Game Cube or something like that.
I:So would your question be on reducing the repercussions then?
R:Yeah.
I:So if the camera was turned off and it was your friend that was there it would be less likely that you would get caught and you would have to deal with whatever?
R:Yeah.
I:Okay so in most cases do you think it’s about good and bad might happen to you or something?
R:Yeah, look at religion too, it’s like most people do good things just to avoid hell.  To avoid the repercussions.  And same thing when you raise kids.  You teach them right from wrong by spanking them when they’re bad and rewarding them when they’re good.  So it’s all about repercussions.
I:If that same Game Cube was in somebody’s hands,
R:No.
I:Would you jump them and take it from them?
R:No,
I:Why not?
R:Cause there would be greater repercussions.  They might come after me or something.
I:But it’s a little geeky guy.  And you’re kind of a big guy.  You’ve got ten pounds from the history class.
R:(laughs) Actually, now that you bring it up, I don’t know, I think it’s conditioning too, cause when you’re little your parents condition you to do stuff like, I’ve bought like a little car thing.  And it was like $18.  I gave him a $20.  The guy gave me $1 and a $20 back as change.  And then I still told him, I was like hey you gave me a twenty back, so I don’t know it’s kind of complicated. It’s like you could probably have a philosophy class on that, I don’t know.","Um, Ana Mae. Ana Mae. Yeah.  Pretty much.

R:Uh, recently pretty much if Everett* would do it, it’s probably wrong.  Uh, I don’t know I don’t normally go with religion, I just more go like, like who would be hurt with this?  And if anyone would be hurt, like really badly then it’s just, then that’s pretty much how it’s wrong.  If uh, if uh, a lot of times, if no one would notice, like data theft, like I don’t really think that’s wrong cause like, uh, you leave it there, it’s like, say if I wanted to steal a song from your computer, I copy the song, you still have your song, I just have it too.  So, it’s an invasion of privacy, but if you don’t know, then no one’s violated, nothing’s hurt.
I:In general, is it easy for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:M3:Uh, for the most part, just a lot of times, well, recently cause we’ve started that feud between me and Everett*, well like he started it, he started, yeah, he started like shouting out crap in class, like telling my ex-girlfriend, like, to grab him in the middle of class, and so then when I would do crap back to him, that was the only time I had trouble deciding whether it was right or wrong, cause it’s like, cause it is wrong, cause I am hurting somebody, but then, he’s asking for it, so I had trouble with that.  And it’s also like if he doesn’t learn now, because he said he gets away with everything, so it’s like if I don’t humble him now, then he’ll do it to other people, and so it’s like if I have the ability to correct it, and I don’t then all those other people that he hurts are on me.  And so that’s wrong, for not acting.  And so I just, that was like one of the hardest years because of that.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, for the most part if it hurts someone then it’s probably wrong, and if it’s, if it makes someone feel good, then it’s probably right.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, regardless of the feelings and hurting somebody?
R:Um,
I:Something could be right or wrong in and of itself?
R:In and of itself?  Uh, I don’t know I think everything’s more abstract.  Anything that’s right could be turned into something wrong.  And vice versa.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?
R:Uh, my dad, my friends, and anime probably
I:Anime?  There’s moral lessons in those cartoons?
R:Yeah, a lot of times there are, yeah.","Uh, recently pretty much if Everett* would do it, it’s probably wrong.

I know you mentioned this earlier.
R:A lot of it’s, sorta, will it screw you up personally, and also will it screw up somebody else?  That’s pretty much the end of it.  Like leaving crap on your table.  You’re making someone else do more work, so it would be right for you to clean it up and it would be wrong to make someone else have to work harder.  So it’s just sort of that.
I:Why would you say – why is it wrong?  Why would that scenario be wrong, to make somebody else do more work?  Who cares?
R:That’s a good question.  I don’t know.  I think the reason I – I don’t know.
I:I’m not trying to undermine your morals, I’m just asking for the reasoning behind it.
R:Yeah, I know.  Trust me, I’ve got into fights with people where I was doing the same thing.  I’m, like, “Why is this?”  They’re, like, “Why are you attacking my deeply held personal beliefs?”  It’s like, “I’m not.  I’m just curious.”  The thing is, now you’re making me realize.  It seems like that was just something that was a belief that was just fed to me and I never questioned.  It was just sort of accepted in there.  So I don’t think I can answer that one.
I:Is it sort of a consequence side or is it more sort of it comes from a larger issue?  I don’t know.  Maybe the consequence would be if somebody does it to you, then you wouldn’t appreciate it, so you don’t do it to others.
R:Yeah.  I think it’s more of a – yeah.  I think it’s probably more of an empathy kind of thing.  You don’t want people doing a bunch of crap to you, so it’s just sorta like a pay it forward kinda thing.  If you bus your table, then if you get a job at a restaurant of something like that, then those people will – other people will bus their tables.
I:Would you say that, in general, it’s easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Generally, it’s pretty easy for me.
I:Has that sort of, making those kinds of decisions, gotten easier for you?  It’s easier to make that decision – over the last couple of years, easier to make that distinction.
R:Yeah.  A couple of years ago, it was pretty bad.  I would think I was morally justified or whatever.  Looking back at it, I’m, like, “I regret that.  I was douche bag.”  Now, I find that it’s fairly easy to do it.
I:So what do you think ultimately it is that makes something right or wrong?  This is sorta about lying or about busing the table.
R:I’d say it’s probably more just the culture that decides what’s right or wrong.  Because, I mean, if you compare different cultures, then that decides what’s right or wrong.  What’s it called?  Damn  it.  I usually have so many examples for this.  Now, I’m a blank.  I’ve just been taking several anthropology classes.  Oh, there’s this one tribe in Africa.  They’re actually two tribes and they war with each other back and forth.  And the women don’t fight at all.  However, when someone, like, as a young girl, whenever someone would get killed, someone close to them, like a brother or father, then they would remove one of her fingers.  That was to teach her to appreciate the deaths of the men.  There, it was kinda shameful if you don’t remove the fingers.  It’s, like, “She’s not going to grow up to be the right type of person.”  If you’re a mother who didn’t remove their daughters’ fingers, then you were a horrible mother and you were raising someone who would be a detriment to society.  Then, of course, to our society, that’s, like, “Oh, my God.  How are you going to do this?  How are you going to remove fingers?”
I:So ultimately you believe that it is sorta culturally driven?
R:Yeah.
I:Culturally relative to what’s defined as right or wrong?
R:Right.
I:Where do you think that your view on moral issues comes from?
R:Probably a combination of my dad and literature, but probably mostly literature, I think.","A lot of it’s, sorta, will it screw you up personally, and also will it screw up somebody else?

I:I’m not telling you stealing is right, I’m just—
R:Well yeah.
I:What, I mean, if somebody, like, like I left this here when I came to find you downstairs, so what if somebody came and said hey, nice little Jukebox 3, and took it.
R:Well I mean I think it’s like different things, if someone’s like, reports it or something and then no one like comes to claim it then you can keep it but like if you just walk into a store or something and take something off the rack or something and stick it in your pocket, then I think that’s wrong.
I:What makes it wrong.
R:Because—
I:What if you, what if somebody walked out and said hey I have something for free, it’s great.
R:Well still, I mean, isn’t that what money is for?  To pay for something so you can buy it?
I:Yeah, so but what if a kid, what if somebody said fine, now I have the money and the thing.
R:I don’t really know.
I:Okay.  All right, I’m not trying to give you a hard time here. Um, where do you think, I mean you clearly have a sense of certain things are right and wrong, where do you think those, your beliefs about right and wrong came from?
R:Ah, my parents, pretty much.
I:What you were taught.
R:So your parents would have taught you this is right and this is…any other source? Teachers pretty much, too.
I:Okay.  Um, so when you think about right and wrong, you pretty much rely on what you were taught by parents and teachers or.
R:Mm-mm (yes).
I:Do you ever question whether what you were taught makes sense or if it’s really true or anything like that?
R:Mm, yeah, sometimes.
I:Like what would be an example of it, maybe you’ve doubted or not sure about, or?
R:Um, well, when I was littler I was doubting like being Christian for some things, like some things don’t sound like right, but I just get along with them now I guess, pretty much.
I:How old were you when you were doubting that?
R:Um, I was like 10 or 11.
I:Do you remember what you were doubting?
R:Um, --
I:There, what were the things that didn’t make sense.
R:Ah, yeah there’s just things that didn’t make sense, I can’t remember what, what they were.
I:Like specific beliefs?
R:Yeah.
I:And did you resolve in your head that now they do make sense or do you not really care whether they do or not, or is?
R:Well I just haven’t really taken the time to think you know like, they’ve been written that way, so, it might be true, I don’t know.
I:Okay.  You mean like things like miracles or hell or Jesus raised from the dead?
R:Like stuff in the Bible, yeah.

One of the things we’re talkin’ with everybody about is sort of morality and moral decision making and how people know things are right or wrong, good or bad.  Do you have any general thoughts about morality?  What’s moral, what’s right or wrong?
R:I don’t know really.  I do what I think is right.  If something seems wrong to you, you can usually sense, me I always, I can, if something’s wrong, you know not to do it.
I:so the way you usually know, it’s like an intuition, it’s automatic?  Or it’s just a feeling or your conscience?
R:well I don’t know, it’s a little bit like all of that.  I mean, if you find a wallet on the ground and your first instinct for me is “oh you should go return that to the police station.” Not just like take it.
I:why not take it?
R:cause, I don’t know, because I spend a lot of time working for things that I want and I’d be like kind of sad if I’d lost a bunch of my stuff I’d hope that someone would do the exact same for me.
I:alright, I’m not trying to change your moral view but just for the sake of argument let me play devil’s advocate.  So you work really hard, and you pay enough attention not to lose your wallet.  If someone else is dumb enough to lose their wallet, then you benefit from it, that’s their problem.  What would you say about that?
R:well, I guess it all depends on your background and where you grew up or whatever.  I was raised, I guess really strict, that if something is wrong you shouldn’t do it.  And my step dad, even though he’s really sick he really enforces doing the right thing to do so, we learned I guess how to be—
I:--where do you think that strictness comes from?  Why are your family strict?
R:my step dad, I got a lot, I learned a lot from him I guess.  Because he grew up by himself because both of his parents abandoned him and he had to learn how to do stuff on his own, so basically he had us do like sort of what he did, but not to the extreme of not having parents, but basically being able to take care of yourself because when you get out of high school it’s a lot easier if you know what to do and you’re already capable of taking care of yourself and you don’t need to be helped by your parents.
I:what do you think it is that makes things right or wrong?
R:um, I don’t know.
I:I mean, I presume, the way you are talking it sounds like you think certain things are right or wrong to do.  Why?  I mean, other than that you were told that in how you were raised.
R:um, the way people act I guess.  In a way, if someone is getting harassed by someone else for no reason other than for how they act, I mean, I don’t think that’s right.  It might not be their fault, they might have a problem at home or something like that.  There are a lot of things that can be a factor for why someone acts the way they act.  But then there’s a lot of ways people act for no reason at all, just because they can because they think that they’re better than everyone else.  And I think that sort of feeds into what’s right and wrong.  Because they’ll make different decisions about what’s right and wrong based on how they grew up and what kind of life they were accustomed to.  Like I guess, if you were rich and your parents were really powerful authority figures than you could get away with a lot more because they’d always be there to bail you out.  So they go and they do things that normal people wouldn’t feel sorry about and wouldn’t have like good moral conscience and all that kind of stuff.  like when someone who’s not as wealthy might grow up and couldn’t buy things, they know that, they know what it’s like to not have anything so they can, they make good decisions and sometimes bad, but it all depends on your situation.
I:so, but is the basis for a bad action or the good action is it just what people decide, what a society thinks, does it come from where?  How do you know what’s right or wrong, I mean you say it’s your conscience or your feelings.  What informs that?  What tells your conscience what makes things right or wrong?
R:I don’t know, just like how you grew up and everything like that.  I don’t really know, you just know it’s wrong so you should try and fix it.
I:if there was a tribe in some other society where people were vicious and eat each other up and slap their wives around and kill people from other tribes, would you say “that’s wrong” or would you say, “well, for them that’s fine?”
R:well, it wouldn’t be right, but if it’s the way that their culture learned to live like a system of how people live their lives I guess, I don’t think violence is good, I think you could like replace it with something else that’s not like mean, to that extent.  But I mean, cultures are gonna be different and they’re gonna have their own traditions and they’re gonna act the way they’ve been acting and you can’t really change that—
I:--but can you judge it?  Can you say “certain things in different cultures and in our own culture are morally wrong?”
R:yeah you could, it all depends on where you stand like, I guess republicans and democrats have different views on the same topic, they think about them differently.","I don’t know really.

R:I think the media, people around, just how I was raised, what my mom and dad taught.  There were basic principles that my parents taught me and so I just go with my gut instinct and I feel like as long as I don’t get sucked into anything that’s too bad, I will be okay.
I:so what do you think it is that makes something wrong or right?
R:well all individuals, everyone has their own different morals, so that’s why there’s so much controversy because every different person thinks different things and I think what I think, but it’s not my part to say if another is doing right or wrong, I can only speak with myself.
I:so are you saying that morality is mostly about a system that’s needed to help people get along in society or is there actually an objective universal moral truth or structure of standards?
R:well… I don’t know and I think it’s mostly pragmatically needing people to get along with each other.
I:so it’s essentially relative to what works and there aren’t any moral standards?  For example if certain individuals have their own moral beliefs, is it possible to ever judge their moral beliefs or decide that they’re wrong if somebody believes something that’s really crazy, can you say that’s morally wrong, or are you stuck with just saying that’s what they believe?
R:well you have to draw the line somewhere or you just end up with total anarchy.  So the government creates broad parameters and then individuals do what they want within them, so the government explains at the farthest outside here’s what you can’t do.  And that’s in the form of laws, but then within that, individuals can do and think what they want to, as long as they’re not too extreme.  People should not be too extreme.
I:so is there anything that guides what people should believe within those parameters?
R:it’s all on an individual basis, you can’t tell somebody else if they were raised differently.  They could have been raised in a totally different situation than you.
I:so what if somebody believed that it was okay to hurt other people in various ways?
R:well, it’s wrong to hurt people.  Especially if the person being hurt didn’t choose it.  And anyway, hurting people goes against the government’s laws.  We have certain amendments, and freedoms, and rights, and liberties, and protections in our society that you can’t violate.
I:so if somebody wanted to date rape somebody, a girl who was drunk, would that be wrong, or would it not be wrong if the person could get away with it and they could advantage of her?
R:no that would definitely be wrong because it wasn’t that person’s choice and the underlying principle is that everyone has different underlying principles, but there is an underlying principle of decency that you should treat other people right and you should let them make choices about their life and not force things on them.  And I think this principle of decency is just common-sense, we’ve come a long way and people should just know that you should treat other people decently.
I:so what if you found a bag of $10,000 that was dropped out of a bank security truck, would you keep the money or would you return it to the bank because the name of the bank was on the bag?  Would it be immoral to keep the money?
R:well what country is the bank from?
I:United States.
R:It would be wrong to keep the money in the United States, but it would not be wrong to keep the money in say an African government that was totally corrupt or totalitarian.  It would be justified because that government’s a bad government anyway and if you could keep the money, then that would be a way of resisting the government, but then again, you might want to not keep the money because such a government would think nothing of hurting you badly if they found out that you kept the money.
I:but in the United States, it would be wrong to keep the money?
R:yes.
I:why? What exactly makes it wrong?
R:well it’s just not yours and people should have to work for what they get, people shouldn’t steal and private property is important.","I think the media, people around, just how I was raised, what my mom and dad taught.

R:I usually make a judgment first about what I think is right or wrong, just saying about like what I believe my own moral code. I ask like for people’s like opinions a lot though on it. But it’s funny that I do because eventually I usually just go with what I believe anyway.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:In general, like big things like obvious things like should I kill or should I not, that’s easy. Little things like how like if I have a problem with like somebody that I don’t want to talk like how I should go about doing it like…I just like…like still…like what would be the right way to handle it, I had trouble with things like that, in more specific things like that.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past two years?
R:About the same, I think.
I:Have your views about what’s right and wrong changed in the past two years?
R:Yeah, kind of on little things. Kind of like…like is it wrong to…like is it wrong to…I used to be strictly against things like pot or would not and now I don’t necessarily think it’s wrong. I think it’s wrong if you like…like smoke a lot of pot and then like start to drive but I don’t there’s anything wrong with like smoking. It’s very similar to alcohol or better actually. Things like that…I mean, I obviously don’t think like slaughtering someone is good or raping.
I:So, why the change with regard to pot. What made the difference?
R:I think it was just when I tried it and like I found out what it is more about I guess, yeah.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:That’s a good question. I guess, wrong, I guess it’s like evil in a way or whatever and I guess good is keeping a good balance in life like harmonious balance between like you and your surroundings and the people in your surroundings. I know like evil people find happiness in like killing people but isn’t like…isn’t harmonious with his surroundings and other people. It’s just more like pleasing himself. I guess, good is more…I guess, good is more worrying about other people than yourself but I could be wrong.
I:So, it might come from a higher power you think?
R:Yeah. It could just you know like it may not be on a slab like the new Ten Commandments but like it’s…it’s in like somebody’s soul I guess.
I:So, are there other things that in our soul, morally speaking?  So not raping, what else?
R:Yeah.
I:What else do you think?
R:Just like how you should treat people I guess, how people should be treated, treat people the way you want to be treated, stuff like that. That’s a soul type of thing.
I:So, the Golden Rules?
R:Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I:Anything else?
R:The treating people thing actually kind of like covers a lot of things. Treating people couldn’t be like…like how you treat like your family or whatever like looking out and who you should look out for like over yourself and stuff like that. I guess it just kind of goes underneath that thing.
I:What about rules or laws?  I mean, technically, pot is against the law.
R:True.
I:But it seems like you’re okay with it?
R:Yeah.
I:So, do you think its okay to break the law?  Is that morally wrong?  Was it morally right to do that? What do you think?
R:If you break the law, I guess like, you can automatically assume that a person like isn’t trustworthy because they break the law, I mean, what else could they break. But I also believe kind of like if—I don’t remember who said it, I think it’s Malcolm X or maybe…yeah, I think its Malcolm X. It was like if…if you don’t believe in a law, you should like break it whatever you can to try to like…like show that it’s wrong but again, he had a point with the, like…like if you’re breaking a law, like what else could you think is right and to like…like change. I know, that’s where I would like. That’s where I would draw the line. But I know a lot of people wouldn’t. But I guess you could say it’s morally wrong to break the law but I don’t think that should be against the law. So…
I:So, if you think that something shouldn’t be you know the law, that it’s okay to…
R:Do it…no, like I don’t think you should kill people if you think it’s…it’s against the law. It’s kind of like again it’s part of the moral code, like knowing what’s right and wrong but some people don’t have obviously. Sociopaths…
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:I feel they kind of just like…I have a strong conscience, I’ve noticed. I don’t know if that was just like programmed, like, I’m probably like my conscience is probably too strong. I don’t mean like…like I’m a perfect person because I’m not.

I’m just like…like, “Oh, why did you do that?  You’re such a…you’re such an asshole” and I don’t think you learn that. I mean, that kind of just like comes with who you are. It’s also shaped by experience I’m sure.
I:Where do your morals come from?

And then I would think of the consequences, and then I would think of how people would react to it.","If it’s against the law and if it will hurt somebody, and if it will cause you to get in trouble or get hurt, or stuff like that. Yeah, basically, and if it will hurt somebody I think it is wrong. (pause) Nobody wants to be hurt, I mean you wouldn’t, if somebody did the same thing to you and it hurt you, you would say it’s wrong. So why would you say it’s okay to hurt somebody else? They come from your intuition and from your mind.  Basic instincts should tell you if you do something whether it will hurt somebody or whether it won’t. I think it’s just going to come right back up then, they’re going to get hurt one day and they’re going to see what they did was wrong. The outcome of it. Yeah. Well you can kind of figure out cause if…say…I don’t know how to put this…you can kind of tell by the personality of the person.  Like if you play a prank on someone that is really sensitive, they’re going to get hurt, but if you play, if you do a prank on somebody that’s really, that likes pranks and laughs a lot, then it’s going to be funny and you won’t hurt them or anything. Yeah, basically. Um, (pause) I usually think, I usually try to figure out what’s the point in doing it, I mean what, what would I get out of doing it.  And then I would think of the consequences, and then I would think of how people would react to it.","The respondent believes that people's sense of right and wrong has diminished, attributing this to a lack of care for consequences, while their own moral compass is guided by intuition and the potential harm to others, and they feel guilty about conflicts with their mother, indicating a strong conscience.",,,,"I:Okay.  And so how do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I’m not really sure.  I guess I just go with my instinct.  If it doesn’t feel right then I won’t do it.
I:Okay.  And so in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I guess it depends on the situation but I think mostly it’s kind of easy because if I don’t feel okay with it, and if I don’t feel that whatever I’m about to do is all right, then I just won’t do it.
I:Okay.  And has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Probably easier.
I:Why do you think that is?
R:I’ve just had  a lot more life experience with people who try to influence you and you just kind of start to see through the, I’m not sure what word to use, you start to see things easier, I guess.  Especially if it’s happened in the past.  You’re like, okay, I did this last time and it ended up badly, so maybe I should do it a different way.
I:Okay.  And so what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Or what’s the, you said you go with your instinct, so what is it that your instinct tells you to do?
R:I’m not really sure how to describe it.  I just, if something feels wrong, then it feels wrong to me.
I:And would it feel wrong because of consequences, or?
R:I think, maybe, for just like my personal beliefs on things or my opinions on some things.  Because I guess some consequences are influence, but, also, mostly, it’s just like my personal beliefs and feelings on the subject.
I:And is there a particular type of feeling? Are you able to describe the feeling?
R:No.","I’m not really sure.  I guess I just go with my instinct.  If it doesn’t feel right then I won’t do it.

R:I think, if it’s right you’ll feel good about it and it won’t be hurting anyone else, you know,
I:Okay.  Yeah.
R:And if it’s wrong, you’ll feel guilty or you know inside that it’s not the right thing to do.
I:Okay.  Okay.  Do you have a time where that has happened to you where you have um, kind of felt um, where you knew that it was something, like maybe at that moment that you had to make a decision of whether it was right or wrong and you kind of based your decision on how you felt or?
R:(pause)  Um,
I:Let me rephrase that question.  When you, do you make decisions based on how you’re feeling about something?

R:I talk to a lot of people, and I get a lot of support that way, and especially older people, and I pray about it.

R:It’s usually pretty easy.
I:And do you think it’s gotten easier or harder in the last few years?
R:Easier.
I:Why?
R:I think I’ve grown a lot.  Yeah, I’ve definitely grown a lot, so yeah, I usually can tell when something’s right or wrong immediately.  But yeah.
I:So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I mean there’s so many situations where you can use that.  I don’t know, in what kind of situation?
I:Well how about… you were saying that you rely on thinking through what Buddhism has to tell you about.  So what is it that Buddhism has to tell you about what a right decision would be or not?  You were kinda talking about it before.
R:Right, right, right, right.  So in Buddhism, I don’t know… let’s say drinking or something, or doing drugs or something.  There aren’t any specific rules as to what… there aren’t any you know, you’re not supposed to drink or you’re not supposed to do drugs or whatever, but I think the main point is, whether you’re doing something that’s good for your life or you’re doing something harmful to your life, so I was kinda saying with the relationship thing, as long as you’re growing as a person, and as long as you’re reflecting on yourself and changing the negative things in your life, then I think it’s fine.  I think it’s also not bad to have fun, so if you wanna drink every once in a while, or moderately or whatever, then that’s fine ‘cause it’s not in the way of you really developing yourself as a person.
I:And where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Through my Buddhist practice.","I talk to a lot of people, and I get a lot of support that way, and especially older people, and I pray about it. It’s usually pretty easy. Easier.

How do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Just what I believe.  I mean, what I, if I have a feeling that something’s going to be wrong I don’t do it. I feel it inside, that’s about it.
I:Is it easy or 	hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy.  I can, I know when I’m doing something wrong.
I:Okay.  Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Easier.
I:Why?
R:Because I have a clearer, my mind is clearer and I can make better decisions, more rational decisions.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, what makes something right or wrong?  Just something that I, how I feel, how I feel about the situation, I mean, if you get a gut feeling inside you that, you know when something’s right or wrong, I mean, it’s all obviously based off of our, how we were brought up and what morals and values that our parents instilled in us, but I think we all have a good idea of what’s right and wrong when we make a decision.
I:So what kinds of consequences would make something wrong?
R:Bad consequences.  What would be a bad consequence?
I:Yeah.
R:I don’t, um, you’re hurting somebody, in any way, I mean you could hurt somebody financially, physically, mentally, you’re hurting yourself .
I:Okay.  Earlier you were kind of describing that gut feeling, like you just know what’s right or you know what’s wrong, so where do those feelings come from?
R:Like I said, I think that when you’re growing up you’re instilled with your parents values that they have, you know, themselves and they sort of base everything off of that and those values, but, I don’t know, it’s just a gut feeling, that’s it, I mean, you know whether or not something’s right or wrong.  I really don’t know what that feeling means or why I have the feelings, I’m guessing that what it’s from though, just the values that I learned growing up.
I:Where do you think maybe those values come from?  I know, I know you said your parents, right, um, I mean are those values just something that has evolved over time, do they come from someplace else, I mean is it just kind of your own, your parents’ opinion, you’re just following after them?
R:Yeah but, I mean, I know that, I know that they’re all values and a lot of them are based off of religion, like that’s how, that’s where everyone gets their values from, I mean, if you see a lot of people that don’t have religions start off obviously some of them end up bad, unless their parents are like some sort of ridiculous philosophers or something, like, they’re going to end up bad, but the thing is is that like I think that everybody has, can be put, have the values instilled in them and everybody can develop their own ideas from them, and that’s what it’s all about.  So I’ve developed my own ideas what right or wrong is and I don’t know, sometimes I just get that feeling I don’t know whether or not that feeling’s, it’s usually the right feeling.
I:Okay.  Um, are there any other places you get your moral views from?  You said your parents, religion,
R:My philosophy ethics class, no, I mean I don’t know, I mean, I’ve learned a lot so I’ve just growing up I’ve learned a lot.
I:Was that class useful?
R:Yeah.
I:Did you just try to pass and get by or did you really get into it?
R:I liked it a lot.  It was an awesome class.  My teacher was awesome, he was a very good teacher and talked a lot about a lot of different issues, many different issues that were, did a lot of critical thinking, so it was, I liked it a lot.  Yeah it was a cool class.
I:Did it help you kind of with these issues at all or did it change your perspective at all?
R:Yeah, somewhat, I mean we learned about different theories and just kind of helped shape my ideas a little more I guess, but didn’t really influence anything too drastically to where I, ‘this is what I’m going to believe’ or ‘this is what I’m going to believe’, but it kind of helped shape my ideas instead.","Just what I believe.  I mean, what I, if I have a feeling that something’s going to be wrong I don’t do it. I feel it inside, that’s about it. It’s easy.  I can, I know when I’m doing something wrong. Easier. Because I have a clearer, my mind is clearer and I can make better decisions, more rational decisions.  Um, what makes something right or wrong?  Just something that I, how I feel, how I feel about the situation, I mean, if you get a gut feeling inside you that, you know when something’s right or wrong, I mean, it’s all obviously based off of our, how we were brought up and what morals and values that our parents instilled in us, but I think we all have a good idea of what’s right and wrong when we make a decision. Bad consequences.  What would be a bad consequence? I don’t, um, you’re hurting somebody, in any way, I mean you could hurt somebody financially, physically, mentally, you’re hurting yourself . Like I said, I think that when you’re growing up you’re instilled with your parents values that they have, you know, themselves and they sort of base everything off of that and those values, but, I don’t know, it’s just a gut feeling, that’s it, I mean, you know whether or not something’s right or wrong.  I really don’t know what that feeling means or why I have the feelings, I’m guessing that what it’s from though, just the values that I learned growing up. Yeah but, I mean, I know that, I know that they’re all values and a lot of them are based off of religion, like that’s how, that’s where everyone gets their values from, I mean, if you see a lot of people that don’t have religions start off obviously some of them end up bad, unless their parents are like some sort of ridiculous philosophers or something, like, they’re going to end up bad, but the thing is is that like I think that everybody has, can be put, have the values instilled in them and everybody can develop their own ideas from them, and that’s what it’s all about.  So I’ve developed my own ideas what right or wrong is and I don’t know, sometimes I just get that feeling I don’t know whether or not that feeling’s, it’s usually the right feeling.  My philosophy ethics class, no, I mean I don’t know, I mean, I’ve learned a lot so I’ve just growing up I’ve learned a lot. Yeah. I liked it a lot.  It was an awesome class.  My teacher was awesome, he was a very good teacher and talked a lot about a lot of different issues, many different issues that were, did a lot of critical thinking, so it was, I liked it a lot.  Yeah it was a cool class. Yeah, somewhat, I mean we learned about different theories and just kind of helped shape my ideas a little more I guess, but didn’t really influence anything too drastically to where I, ‘this is what I’m going to believe’ or ‘this is what I’m going to believe’, but it kind of helped shape my ideas instead.","The respondent makes decisions based on their gut feelings and the values instilled by their parents, believing that right and wrong are clear to them, and they prioritize following the advice of respected adults over personal happiness or religious guidance."

R:I really don’t think there is.  I mean, you know, it’s really up to the person, you know, if they want to live, you know, I don’t want to take anyone on a guilt trip you know but if someone does something wrong, what I think is wrong it could be right to someone else.  They have a different point of view so one person’s right could be another person’s wrong.
I:And where do your own views of what’s right and wrong come from do you think?
R:Um, just you know, just having to make different choices and you know, well thinking if I did this or that then it would be a better outcome.

I:Or seem right and be wrong?
R:Like when I first began dating I was very blind as to how to treat my boyfriend you know, whether like he’d ask me oh who else do you like and things like that and you know I didn’t think it was right for me to lie to him and say you know well I don’t like anyone but then again it was wrong for me to tell him too cause you know he is my boyfriend and it wasn’t exactly the right thing to do.  So you know, I made a choice to tell him and eventually our relationship ended, not that it was going to last forever, but you know I do regret doing that, but then again I don’t.  So you know it gives you a different decisions that I made, like especially with dating you know I’ll look back on different things that maybe if I did this or that you know I’d still be going out with them. But then again I wouldn’t be going out with this person, you know, so it’s kind of like that.","I really don’t think there is.

I:So why do you think it’s wrong to be an asshole?
R:Well I think it’s, just to be a jerk as it, like for no reason, but if you have a problem with somebody or you don’t get along with them, there’s no reason you should pretend like you get along with them, but I mean, if you’re just, don’t know somebody and you just like, rude to them or something like that, for no reason then it’s just, it’s not right.","My parents.

(pause) How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:You can usually tell.  But on difficult decisions I usually consult people.  And there’s the two heads are better than one.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Well it all depends on the situation, like,
I:Just kind of day to day, do you feel like you spend a lot of energy thinking about kind of choose what is right or wrong or not?
R:Yeah.  But I have like a wandering mind.
I:Yeah?
R:Like when I’m working, I don’t think about my work, like my mind wanders, I don’t think about my work.  So yeah, I do, I think about it a lot actually.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Easier to tell what’s right and wrong.  But harder because the choices become more complicated.  When I was a kid things were like, do this or don’t do this, but now it’s like throw some other things in there, and it becomes more complicated.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:It’s hard to tell.  It’s how you feel about it.  But some people have no conscience, so.
I:How do you think they get that way?
R:It’s like an animal, not like an animal like that, but they just do things to get by, they don’t think of the consequences or anything.  They don’t have the forethought.  I don’t know if that’s the right word, but they don’t have any like, planning, they just do like crazy things just for the minute that’s why they get in trouble.  But I think that’s how they were raised though.  It has a lot to do with how you were brought up.
I:Okay.
R:Cause most of the people that I know like that, you can look at their families and you can see what’s going on.  I think the family is like the key to see why people are the way they are.
I:Yeah.
R:Like if you know someone really well, and you see them interact with their family, you can kind of get a glimpse into their life.  Cause people don’t, no matter who you are but you’re their friends, but no one ever acts the same way in front of their family as they do with their friends.  I think you can fairly say that.  And like your family is like who you’re closest to, you might hang out with your friends, but your family, they affect you the most, so you can just see how you are and how your family interacts with each other and stuff like that.
I:Yeah.  So those feelings you were talking about, like the feeling that something’s right or wrong, where do you think those feelings come from?
R:(pause) How it affects other people.  How it affects you.  You know, whether it’s like physically, emotionally, some other way that’s hurting somebody.  I mean usually if a lie’s involved you can usually tell what’s going on.  If you have to lie in the sequence, you can tell what’s going on.
I:Do you think we all just naturally have something in us that makes us feel one way or another?  Or where do you think that comes from?
R:I think you do.  It depends on who you are.  Some people just lie like crazy, they just say whatever, but some people don’t.  They don’t ever say anything like that.  And it just goes back to how your family was.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Yeah.
I:To everyone?  What kind of things?

R:Sometimes.
I:So, does that affect you in some way? When you make your decisions, do you mainly look at the consequences for everybody, or is it?
R:On big things, it would be consequences, on little things, I just do what feels right.
I:What about rules and laws?  Do they matter, are there certain principles that you should never break?
R:No.
I:Does something like God’s will, some kind of spiritual thing matter?  Does that ever factor into your decision making?

R:I think my own feelings are pretty reliable
I:your insights you would say or some sort of gut feeling?
R:well I guess gut feeling when it comes down to things that I'm not—I mean I try to think about things thoroughly, I try to think of everything thoroughly but if I cant, if I come to a limit, that’s when I have to, but I wouldn’t like to.
I:so generally you trust your feelings you would say?
R:well not my initial feelings, I have to think about it for awhile before I know what to think about and I realize that my initial reaction, my gut feelings are usually unreliable
I:and in general do you find it easy or hard to decide what is right or wrong?
R:I think it’s hard, I think it’s always hard.
I:and has this become easier or harder over the past couple of years?
R:probably harder, just because I think about it a lot more now than I did before.
I:and have your views of right and wrong changed over the past couple years?
R:maybe a little bit.  I guess not really, I never really bought into anything, I mean if somebody told me something that I dunno, I can’t really think of anything in particular.
I:what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:well, I guess I'm more like utilitarian in that sense because I think it’s kinda arbitrary what we think of as right or wrong.  I don’t think there’s a set rule book to tell us what right or wrong is but we kinda have to take, add up the bad and the good and see which one overpowers the other.
I:would you say it’s consequences? That overall the consequences benefit a lot of people is that generally how you say it?
R:yeah, well the biggest criticism against utilitarianism is that a really fortunate person, like a really rich person, say, was going to have a lot of pleasure by inflicting small discomforts to a lot of really poor people, and if his pleasure was bigger than a discomfort than he inflicts then it’s moral to support him.  But I think if you think of utilitarianism thoroughly, if you don’t just dismiss it I think that’s—why else would we do things?  I just don’t see how you can define what is good and what is bad in any other way.
I:Apart from consequences, benefits?
R:and I mean there has to be a benefit, you don’t do things because they hurt you, it makes sense, but people don’t understand when people say why do people, say, smoke.  We are getting something out of it.  They are getting something out of it, that’s why they do it, they don’t do it because they want to kill themselves.
I:what about feelings?  Some people say what’s right is what feels right to you and that’s about it regardless of consequences?
R:Regardless of consequences? I wouldn’t feel right if the consequences weren’t good, so I guess it is feelings if you think of it that way.
I:what about rules or laws or are there things that simply are wrong absolutely.
R:things that are absolutely wrong? I couldn’t think of anything that was absolutely wrong, just because I can always think of some really obscure theoretical situation where that would be excusable and you could say that rape is absolutely wrong and for all intents and purposes I would agree with that, but you can always set up a situation where a whole country is going to be destroyed unless you rape somebody and if you rape somebody then the country gets saved, but you know, I don’t think anything’s absolutely wrong.
I:where do you think you’ve acquired your moral views from, where do they come from?
R:I think they I guess I could say they come from myself, but I guess that wouldn’t be very accurate because I think I’ve been influenced by a lot of other things, I'm influenced by a lot of things it’s not just all from me.
I:are these from your parents?
R:yeah a little from my parents
I:what from you parents or what from maybe your friends or other people or a combination?
R:yeah it would probably have to be, but from my parents, I don’t know. I don’t really talk to them about this a lot I kind just accept that they can believe whatever the heck they want no matter how crazy it is as long as it doesn’t have anything to do with me. I mean to me it just seems that they believe whatever Catholicism as long as the Pope says its law, the Pope changes his mind, they change their mind, too.  I don’t really know what to say.
I:so you wouldn’t say that they’re not much of an influence on your morals? I think you said that utilitarianism is right, but when did you acquire that idea or what influenced you there?
R:probably in high school, I just thought about it and I read about it.","I think my own feelings are pretty reliable well I guess gut feeling when it comes down to things that I'm not—I mean I try to think about things thoroughly, I try to think of everything thoroughly but if I cant, if I come to a limit, that’s when I have to, but I wouldn’t like to. well not my initial feelings, I have to think about it for awhile before I know what to think about and I realize that my initial reaction, my gut feelings are usually unreliable I think it’s hard, I think it’s always hard. probably harder, just because I think about it a lot more now than I did before. maybe a little bit.

R:From the way I was raised.
I:OK.
R:If I was younger and I was told not to do that, then when I’m older it reflects on me. That’s it, I guess. You can’t say certain things, so that’s on me now. Like, when I was younger, you weren’t allowed to curse. So it’s like really in my system that if I do curse, I know that it was bad for me to curse. It’s just like a conscience thing.
I:Do you ever feel a point where you feel kind of like, there’s a gray area where you didn’t really know what to do? Have you ever had a situation like that?
R:No.
I:So, what do you think makes something right or wrong?
R:Umm, the consequence afterwards.
I:Ok. Give me an example of the kind of consequence you might get after.
R:Well, if you save a baby, you’ll be praised. You know, you don’t get in trouble for it. But if you shake a baby, you get in trouble for it. It depends on what happens afterwards. What is the outcome. Or how you feel.
I:What if you didn’t know that it was wrong to shake a baby?
R:It’s still wrong; you just didn’t know that it was. So your mind frame, it doesn’t depend, it’s still wrong.
I:So let’s say, you shook the baby and the baby got injured in another (??) no other consequences.
R:It’s very wrong. Yeah, because that’s a consequence, because the baby got injured. That’s a consequence; the outcome is that the baby was hurt, so it’s still wrong.
I:Even if nobody else thought it was wrong?
R:No
I:What if the baby didn’t get hurt?
R:I still feel like it was wrong because that’s, basically that’s child abuse. Because it’s a baby. You don’t do that to a child. You don’t do that to anybody, but it’s still a child. You have no reason to shake a baby. You have no reason to hurt a baby. Because they’re just babies, they don’t understand, so.
I:I’m trying to think of an example of something that could be potentially wrong, but not because of consequences. I mean, you can think of things where, let’s say that you lie to someone. And nobody got hurt.
R:I still feel like that’s wrong because you’re supposed to tell the truth.
I:So if there were no consequences, why was it wrong?
R:It’s the moral of it. It’s really basically the moral, that you know you’re not supposed to lie. You know you did something, you should tell. If your acts, you should tell the truth.
I:Ok, so I gave an example of one. Are there any other behaviors, actions, incidents, thoughts, or whatever that you think would be wrong regardless of consequences that you can think of? Regardless of what happened afterwards, nothing would happen to you or anyone else. (pause). Not off the bat, you can’t think of one? (pause) Ok.

R:How I feel.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide?
R:Sometimes it’s hard.  But usually, it’ll be easy because if I feel like it’s wrong, then I won’t do it.  But when it involves other people that you love, and their opinions, it’s a hard decision.
I:Right.  Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:Harder.  Because – were you going to ask because?
I:Yeah.
R:It’s gotten harder because as you get older, your choices and your decisions that you have to make, become greater.  When I was 12, or when I was in 10th grade, I had to decide what to wear to school, or what phone I wanted.  Now I have to decide on what career’s going to be best for me.  I have to decide on how am I going to make my life better for me and someone else.  I have to decide on whether or not the person that I’m planning to live the rest of my life with, is the person that I should be with for the rest of my life.  So my decisions get a little harder because… whether it’s easy or hard, gets a little harder because the decisions or the choices become a little different than what they used to be.

R:The reasons behind it.
I:What do you mean?
R:I mean what makes something right or wrong is the reasons why you do it.
I:Ok.  So people’s intentions?
R:Yes, your intentions of why you’re doing it.  Like, I think using drugs is wrong in any case, but it’s right if it’s going to help you live.  But as for, you know, like people who use drugs just because they want to reach a high, or people who kill theirselves because they feel like they can’t get by, I feel like that’s wrong, because you didn’t even give yourself a chance.

And then I have some of my friends usually that are pulling me out of it. Yeah.  I tend to rush to judgment though. Because I don’t like to hold onto one thing for too long. Kind of like I think I jump around really quickly, I think if something is wrong I get annoyed. I just go with what my gut says.  It’s usually right. And then if you get too involved with the principles of things, like, if you follow everything like to the letter of the law, like if you do something wrong, like the abortion issue, you can kill someone.  But it’s wrong, it doesn’t matter.  The courts says it’s legal.  If your gut tells you it’s wrong it’s wrong. I think it’s actually ingrained in you, but that’s just a reaffirment. I think it’s pretty much as your conditioning as a child.  You know that helps conditioning, your religion. Pretty much.  Except for the religious fundamentalist, cause those are the people that are getting us all killed.  If people think that things are justified by religion, bombing people isn’t going to justify anything.  It’s just gonna, it’s gonna require retaliation, which they will retaliate, and then you’ll be on a downward spiral to hell. Yes. Yes.  Just because something is written about in the Bible or the Koran or any of those religious texts, it doesn’t mean that that’s what the message is.  I mean they’ve stone, they used to stone people for prostitution, we don’t do that anymore, cause it’s morally wrong.  The whole message, once Christianity came or anything, you just moved passed that and you forgive people. What do you mean by that?  Like how people get the wrong judgment or? Because you don’t look at the whole picture. You just look at they stoned her, that’s not going to teach you anything. It’s like ooh, we can, we can take it, see in the Bible they stoned people, see we can kill people, that’s not anything.  That’s not the point of this.  The point is to move past it and to forgive.

That things should follow the natural course, so it’s like, it’s really weird, you go into some deep philosophy there.
I:Yeah.  So do you feel that you try to apply those ideas when you like,
R:I think you naturally apply them when you read.
I:Okay.
R:Like if someone did evil and there were good ends, the ends are sort of the x evil and if there were good intentions and have evil ends, is the affect to the tribe any good?
I:Yeah, good question.  So do you have any sense of what you’d put more weight on the intentions or the consequences or?
R:No. You see, the thing is if the killer goes out to kill the biggest serial killer ever, then that’s a good thing, but he did it for evil reasons.  What’s if someone believes that there’s terrorist and they go out and kill them, they had good intentions to keep people from getting hurt, but they kill people a lot.

I:Yeah.  You said one of the things you like to talk to people about and debate is the war in Iraq, so how do you feel, do you feel that that’s morally right or wrong?
R:I think it’s about oil and nothing more.  If it was about something more than oil, then we’d be in Rwanda and Sudan right now where there’s ethnic cleansing going on.  But we’re not, so I actually know it’s about nothing more than oil.
I:Okay.   Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?

I:We’ll get back to that in a second.  How did, what made that right or wrong?
R:It’s just how it is.
I:You just woke up one day and that’s what you knew was right.
R:No, it’s not I didn’t wake up one day, I mean it’s always been that way and I came out of my mother’s womb and it’s been that way.
I:So you were born with the intuitive sense of right and wrong.
R:Of cruelty to animals, I know, I have always known not to smack, you know smack a dog or,
I:okay, okay, um,
R:Except for mosquitoes, I don’t like mosquitoes.
I:Do you think there’s anything, was there anything about right or wrong that you had to learn?  That somebody had to teach you?
R:Well, yes.
I:Okay.
R:You know you’re not supposed to go and poop on someone’s face.
I:Right, so manners would be,","Because animals are beings, too, animals are alive. Like eating them?  Eating them’s just bad. Because you’re taking the life of a living them. Killing is bad but you never go to war with animals, and there’s never, you know animals are living and the co-existence. Not being kind to, kind to others when you need to be kind to others, to an extent to animals. I don't know, I’m a vegetarian. Yeah. It’s just how it is. No, it’s not I didn’t wake up one day, I mean it’s always been that way and I came out of my mother’s womb and it’s been that way. Of cruelty to animals, I know, I have always known not to smack, you know smack a dog or, Except for mosquitoes, I don’t like mosquitoes. Well, yes. You know you’re not supposed to go and poop on someone’s face. You know, manners is an example, but that depends on the culture. Pooping on someone’s face in some culture probably could be considered you know very respectful, who knows. In America, it’s not right. And cultures, in western culture, in, it’s not right, um, doing it, killing a chicken, taking it’s bones, doing a craft with it and frying it and eating it, that’s wrong. But if you’re gonna use, like the native American way, of you know that’s right, that’s fine. So it also depends on the situation. But in, where I live and the people around me, and the people, you know in this country, it’s wrong.","The respondent makes decisions based on a combination of intuition and practical wisdom from sports, considers the consequences of actions, acknowledges the influence of his parents' beliefs on his vegetarianism, and recognizes that moral judgments can vary significantly depending on the situation.","I:Yeah.  Okay.  How do you decide or know what is good and bad, and right and wrong in life?
R:Just do.  I just, I don’t, there’s no real basis.  I’m not religious at all, so.   I don’t think about morals and I just think what’s wrong and right.
I:In general, is that like a hard or easy decision for you?
R:Pretty easy.
I:Pretty easy.
R:I’m never really in a situation where I’m like, should I do this?  Is it bad?  Like.
I:Are there different areas where like, where you think it’s harder to make a decision than others?
R:On tests, not really.
I:Like cheating kind of stuff?
R:No, no, no.
I:No, okay.
R:Just like decide like should I pick a or c.
I:Oh yeah, get down to the wire, yeah.
R:Yeah, that stuff, that’s pretty much easy.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:I’d say the same.  Not really.
I:Really.  So going to high school didn’t change any of that?
R:No.
I:Okay.  We’re gonna continue on this one.  So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?  Is it affects on other people, is it how it makes you feel?
R:It’s what I think is right or wrong, I don’t, I don’t think there’s any outside influence for me on what’s right or wrong, you know.  Or no single answer, but, but I make my—
I:So different per situation?
R:I make my own decision based on the situation.
I:Okay.  Um, what about consequences?  Does that ever figure into your decisions?
R:Yeah.  I mean, if my parents are, I’m not like looking to upset my parents or anything, that’s not why I, that’s not what I’m trying to do.  Let me throw this out.   Yeah I’m not trying to just like upset my parents, you know, that’s, if, if there is gonna be a huge consequence for doing something, I won’t do it.
I:Okay.  Is that because you don’t want to deal with the consequence or because you don’t want to upset your parents, or both?
R:No, I just prefer not to deal with the consequence.
I:Okay, okay.
R:I don’t really do anything that would really upset my parents that much except for probably like lighting fireworks off on people’s doorsteps and stuff, but nothing, but.
I:So why is that an issue?  Why don’t they like you doing that?
R:Just because they say, you know, you could make a mistake and you know, catch something on fire, that’s the only reason they care.  They just don’t want me to like light someone’s house on fire, but if I’m with my friends and we’re doing stupid stuff like throwing fireworks on top of like my friend’s car while it’s driving, I mean.
I:So why do you keep doing this stuff?
R:Why?  It’s fun.
I:
R:And there’s no, there’s really not a high risk at all of the car lighting on fire, so.  It’s just kind of fun.
I:So you’ve looked into it a little bit.
R:Yeah.
I:Yeah, okay, okay.  Are there any things or actions that are always wrong in themselves, no matter what?
R:Yeah.  Killing people.  That’s pretty wrong.
I:What makes killing people wrong?
R:Um.  Because .  If you shoot somebody or you poison somebody or if you cut someone’s head off or whatever, they’re, you’re ending their life.  I don’t know.  I just try and, well, no, but I think the death penalty is okay so I don’t know if killing people in every situation is always wrong.  I don’t think there’s anything that’s, that’s wrong one hundred percent of the time.
I:Nothing’s wrong all the time.  So war killing might be okay, but on the street, maybe not okay?
R:Yeah, yeah.
I:Do you know where that line is?  Like where?
R:No.
I:No.
R:There's no, I don’t think there’s an answer for where that line is.
I:Okay.  Let’s see.  Where do you think you’ve come about this idea of morality and your moral views?
R:I don’t really think about morals that much.  I just think about, I just like do it or don’t do it.  And I’m really not that focused on my morals, my ethics.","Just do.

R:I just do, I don’t have any like moral code that I adhere to.  Um, I mean you know killing people in almost every situation is wrong, that sort of thing.  That’s probably the example.
I:So would you say it’s like a feeling or an intuition?
R:I don’t know, I just kind of do what I feel is right and I don’t, yeah an intuition would be a good description.
I:So normally how easy or hard is it for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s pretty easy.
I:Do you feel like deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the last couple years at all?
R:Uh, nope.
I:Okay, do you feel like your views about right and wrong have changed at all in the last couple years?
R:Yeah, probably a little bit.
I:How so?
R:Well just, I tend to, you know I tend to make judgments about situations and I’ll wait and evaluate and then make a decision, um, but I think I’ve, I think I understand more now that I have to look into each individual situation before judging an action that somebody else does and look, you know, understand that person, that individual person, what, the reason that they did that.  so I have a little more, and I, before evaluating a situation I will have a little more leeway, I’ll give somebody else a little more maybe credibility before saying what they did was wrong.
I:Any particular reason why you think that’s changed?
R:Yeah, I think I had, there was an event where my, at my high school, they call it Beach Week where all the seniors go to the beach for a week after graduation, basically do a lot of drugs and buy drugs and they start um, they did a lot of drinking and I was there and I was just very, um, I was very displeased with the whole situation because I thought it was too excessive and it was too excessive.  But these kids were basically like you know we’re your friends and you have to understand kind of what we’re doing here and how this is a week thing and I just said well this isn’t just going to be a week thing, you know you’re going to start developing habits here and sure enough they do it while it’s there and they go off and so they’re having major issues at school now.  But, but I still had to, I couldn’t make the immediate judgment, I had to kind of understand and go through for each individual person, the reason they were doing things.  So I think there just need to be more thought in a situation.
I:So this is just generally, kind of an abstract question, but what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Uh, you’ve got me, that’s a good question, I don’t know the answer to that one.
I:Do you think that maybe rules or laws or consequences or how it feels or anything like that may have something to do with it or is it not necessarily that clear?
R:No, I don’t think there’s a clear answer to what is right or wrong.
I:So would you say that that is something that’s unclear, um, to a lot of people or do you think that it’s unknowable like in a general sense? Or how would you describe how, in what way is it unclear is what I'm asking you?
R:Well I think for a lot of people I think they rely on religion as a guidance but religion doesn’t have all the answers, it just has a philosophical and you know uh, rules that people kind of developed over time that they’ve learned, they bring down to these groups and they decided that’s what we want.  So I don’t, I don’t know—can you say the question again—?
I:That’s okay, I was just asking if you thought that knowing kind of what makes something right or wrong is just something that’s confusing and hard to know for most people including like yourself or do you think it’s something that’s ultimately unknowable to people?
R:Yeah, we— okay, I think it’s very confusing and I think it’s something that people don’t know.  people try to come up with ways in which they can guide themselves and religion is one of those ways that is a way to provide a stable guide because it’s hard, it’s very hard for an individual to say , it’s hard for an individual to sit there and think and, and not have some guidance, you know, because then you can feel lost if you don’t have a certain, you know if you don’t have a guide.
I:So where would you say your ideas about morality or right and wrong have come from or what has influenced you the most?
R:I don’t know, I guess my education probably and my number one, my first, um, base for judgment there.  And family and discussions with people and books that I’ve read by I can’t even think of a specific book that would affect that.","I just do, I don’t have any like moral code that I adhere to.

R:pretty easy, I think.
I:has it gotten easier in the past couple years or has it gotten harder?

R:well in self defense of course.  It would be nice if you didn’t have to use self defense because other people shouldn’t be attacking you in that situation, but if you have to then it’s alright, it’s right I guess, well it’s not right but it’s what you have to do.

R:Easy to decide between right and wrong, hard for me to decide between right and - right number one and right number two.

R:How you feel about it, I guess, and obviously if it's completely illegal and immoral, that's another situation.

I:Sure. Was there anything good or bad about what is  you in that situation? About her intentions and…?
R:No, I mean I thought her intentions in the beginning were good.

Usually, pretty easy. Probably more difficult just because the decisions have gotten really difficult so.  Well, I guess it would depend on the situation but I think that most of it is the intentions that you have but are your intentions good?

I:Okay.

I:Okay.  And how, if um, where, you said that there are some things that are right and wrong for everybody?  Where do those come from?  What’s the criteria on something that’s right or wrong for everyone?
R:Um, I think it’s kind of like rules for society. Like killing or stealing or raping or something.
I:Right.
R:But I think other than the common like, this is wrong in this circumstance, like you should never kill anyone really, or you should never rape somebody.  I think that’s up to the individual.
I:What if a whole society decided, or we as a society decided that it’s okay to kill people.  Would that be all right?
R:No.
I:Why not?

R:I don’t know. I think I have some sort of… I think it just comes from internally and I think much of that comes from my parents but I think it just like big belief in my common sense like I think that that rules a lot of stuff.
I:Is it generally pretty easy for you to figure out what’s wrong or right?
R:Yes, mostly because I’m many times a very black and white person but also it’s not always good. And in so many cases, it does help. I just know I don’t want to do it so I don’t do it.
I:Do you think it has gotten easier or harder the past couple of years?
R:I think for a little bit, harder and maybe now a little easier because I’ve kind of tested the waters a little and I’ve decided what, you know you kind of decide what you want to do right and wrong in your own life. After you try some stuff, you decide, it didn’t really feel good or like… I think it might be inherent. I think if it’s something you would feel good about at the end of the day, if it’s something you feel, if it’s something you’re not going to second guess and it’s definitely right but I think you sometimes second guess things that are right anyway. You may think a lot of times things that are right are really hard and I also think sometimes things that are right aren’t necessarily the thing that you should you know like things sometimes what people think of as right are really restricted and then they end up doing something else that’s way off the other way.
I:Do you have something you’re thinking about in particular?
R:I just I mean I know people that grew up in very sheltered households where like you know like I have a friend who’s like very, very Catholic and her family, she grew up in this household where she didn’t know any other way and she got to college and she kind of went crazy but she also like doesn’t feel good about going crazy because it’s wrong and there’s like this whole mishmash going on in her head. She just doesn’t know what’s going on and I feel like having something being so set as right and wrong it’s like kind of like heavy basis.
I:So from where have you acquired your moral views?  Who has influenced you?
R:My parents. I think my friends. I mean I think I can talk about some of that stuff with my friends and maybe some of my teachers and a lot of it is just based on what you see and what you experience. Much of the time you see something that you don’t like and you decide you don’t want to do it.
I:Have your views about right and wrong changed in the past three years? Two years?
R:Yeah, I would say a little bit.
I:How so?
R:I think if you go back three or so years, I was much more sheltered like a lot of things teenagers did were like wrong and I think it was just because I think they were like scary and foreign to me and I think now I realize that they’re not so wrong that they can be fun instead of dangerous.
I:You mean like drugs, alcohol, that type of stuff or…?
R:I think yes, I think that alcohol for one is definitely the case. I think I used to think it was this really big deal scary thing, like it can be obviously.
I:Yeah, abuse, yeah.
R:But not really you know like especially when the teenagers use it like, yes, some people are unhealthy but like it really is okay and like very commonplace. It can be fun and make me a little happy.
I:Is there anything that you wont compromise morals-wise, in terms of morality?

I don’t know, like Yeah.","The respondent would prioritize saving the money for their mother's needs and college expenses rather than making big purchases, relying on their intuition about future regrets, and believes that their moral compass is shaped by personal feelings and upbringing, emphasizing the importance of helping others while maintaining their own well-being.","I:Okay, how do you normally decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I guess it’s kind of a gut feeling.  I don't know, I just - like you have your - yeah, if it feels right.  I guess, I mean, afterwards you kind of know because - or I guess, you can look at it like, “Am I going to regret this later?”
I:Regret, okay.
R:But I mean, I think it’s kind of just a “shoot from the hip” kind of thing.
I:Is that generally pretty easy to decide what’s right and wrong?
R:Yeah, I don’t tend to struggle over decisions too much, so.
I:Okay, and has that changed over the past couple years?
R:No, not really.  I think I’ve always been that way.
I:Okay, that’s fair.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Well, I guess, it’s like how you feel after it’s done.  I mean, there's always the social concept of it.  How does society look at it, but I guess, I’d be more concerned with how I can live with it, and whatnot.
I:So what if somebody was to go around saying, “It really feels great to me to stab other people at the bookstore.”
R:Yeah, I mean, obviously that’s wrong because even if it feels good to you it obviously sucks for somebody else.  So I mean, yeah, that’s pretty crappy.  But I’m a big believer in do whatever you want in your life so long as it doesn’t adversely affect other people.
I:Okay, so harm could be say, wrong.
R:Yeah, exactly, yeah.
I:So what about war?
R:I mean, you know, I definitely believe that there are times or places, it’s like - it’s, yeah, not the right thing to do, but it’s not the wrong thing to do.  It’s unavoidable.  I don’t believe that everything can just be talked out.  Sometimes it just comes to force, so that answers the question.
I:So maybe that’s a grey area in there?
R:I mean, yeah, it’s kind of a grey area, and it’s kind of something that people have to - large groups of people obviously have to decide together to do.
I:Okay, so from where have you acquired your moral views?  Who’s influenced you?
R:Probably my dad more than anything.
I:And why your dad?  Like, why not your mom, I guess.
R:Well, I don't know, I mean, we were always like, I mean, we obviously - we’re a pretty close family, and it’s not like we’re not close with my mom.  And this - I mean, this really does kind of go with, for all three of us, but we were just so extremely close with my dad.  He was like in a lot of ways, he’s your dad, but my best friend kind of too.  So I mean, that just had like -
I:It’s not a flaw of your mom, it’s just that you were close to your dad.
R:Yeah, exactly.  Well, he was kind of - because he did the same thing I do now actually.  He owned his own business, so when we were sick he was a lot times the one that stayed home with us.  He took us on fieldtrips for school.  I used to go on trips with him sometimes.  We would go - we went to Palm Springs a couple times, went golfing, just the two of us.  And he did little trips with all three of us individually, and then sometimes just, yeah, he would take us.
I:So you had a lot time to talk about things.
R:Yeah, exactly.  We were just like really, really close.  And it’s kind of funny because my friends were pretty close with him.  And so were my brother’s and sister’s friends, so he’s like, yeah, because he was one of those, like, he never missed any kind of sport’s thing because he could make that kind of time.

I:Okay um, and where do your own views of right and wrong come from?
R:Um mine come from my parents, you know, they taught me what to do and what not to do from an early age, so.
I:Okay um, and how do you decide or know like what is good and bad, or right and wrong in life?
R:Um, well just from what I’ve been taught in school and from my friends and everything, I know that you know what, what I should do, should I come and face problems, but, just from parents and growing up and everything.
I:Okay um, and, can you give me any examples of something that might be right or wrong, or?

How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:Um, well I know because I, I go back to my beliefs, what is right and wrong and things that I’m not sure about, even with my beliefs, I definitely pray about, I talk to my family about, so if I’m ever not sure, I talk to people who are closest to me about it.
I:Okay.  In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:It’s easy just, I mean, for the most part.  There are always the problems where you’re not quite sure what you should be doing, but I know like by gut instinct what feels right in situations, so.
I:Where do you think that gut instinct comes from?  Do you think it’s just some natural thing we all have?  Does it develop somehow, what’s going on?
R:Um, I think in some cases it’s a natural instinct.  You know, like when you’re in a situation if you should be there or not, just a feeling that you get but also I think that it, it comes from my certain beliefs sometimes.  Like I have to think, would this be something that I would want to do, and be proud of doing, just those kind of things.
I:Okay.  Do you think deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or more difficult over the past couple of years?
R:Um, I believe it’s gotten easier, overall.  I mean, the problems that I’m dealing with, trying to figure things out with, have changed, just because of the different environments that I’m involved in now.  But I think that it’s become easier because I’ve seen different things, gone through different experiences, no longer in the drama of high school and everything.  So it’s definitely changed.
I:Okay.  What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think if it’s, I guess bottom line good or bad for you, I mean if it comes out and it’s something that you really shouldn’t have done and definitely it was the wrong thing to do it, but I mean if it feels right, if it’s right for you at the time, then I think it’s the right thing to do.
I:Okay, so for you personally, what are some of your guidelines for what makes things right or wrong?
R:Um, I just, I have very strong morals so if it goes along with my faith, my beliefs, my morals then it’s the right thing for me to do, and that’s just something that I know right away.  Like, going back to the drinking and party thing, I just, it’s something I’m not interested in doing, it goes against what I’ve been taught by my parents and my faith, so it’s just not something I want to do.
I:Um, yeah, it sounds like you have some really strong guiding principles in terms of your beliefs and morals and things.  Do you have a sense for, um, do you just kind of follow those to follow them, because you think it’s important to follow rules or do you also think about kind of the, what’s behind the rules, like why they’re good to follow them, do you know what I mean?
R:Yeah, definitely, and like I think of, of course, consequences and everything but also it’s, like I said earlier, it’s something like will I later think of it and still be proud of my actions, it’s something that, it’s more like will you want to do the things that you give into, is it that big of a temptation.","Um, well I know because I, I go back to my beliefs, what is right and wrong and things that I’m not sure about, even with my beliefs, I definitely pray about, I talk to my family about, so if I’m ever not sure, I talk to people who are closest to me about it.

R:I just kind of base it off of what I’ve been taught, religiously and also morally.  I know in my heart if it’s something that I’m just not comfortable doing.  If I’m not sure, I always talk to family, friends, trusted parents’ opinions, and that base itself.  Just things that I would feel uncomfortable doing in my heart.

I:Do you think it’s gotten easier or harder over the last 2 years?
R:I think it’s gotten easier just because I’ve kind of settled into my life, and I was finishing up school, wasn’t dealing with all the things I maybe dealt with in high school.  I found that college was a very different time.  So I think it was easier to make those independent decisions.
I:Do you think your views have changed a lot in the last couple of years?
R:I would say so.  They might have changed in maybe in the political sense, or just moral sense, become more open to hear the other opinions of people and other outlooks people can have, other perspectives.  So probably, just become more open, more accepting.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it’s people’s own opinions, their upbringings and what they’ve been taught religiously, or by their parents or stuff they’ve been taught by their own lifestyle decisions.  I think it’s more just personal decisions, personal choices that people make.
I:So when you make a choice, is it based on consequences, or a feeling that you have?
R:I think it’s based on all of that.  I do consider consequences of some of the actions, I consider how I feel instinctively.  Just how I want to be presented to society, things like that.  All those kind of issues. (00:22:17)
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:I think partly from upbringing, and partly from my religion(s).

I:Okay if you, if, um, just, just to sort of see what you mean by this, um, so if you, if somebody can do something with a clear conscience and it’s up to them to decide what’s right and wrong, how do we know, how do they know where to draw the lines, I mean, for example, somebody might cheat on a test, or might do drugs or might even hurt somebody else,--
R:Yeah.
I:How do, ah?
R:I don’t know.
I:Yeah, if they feel okay about it.  You know they don’t, they don’t feel guilty about it.
R:Well I guess if they’re fa—actually, well cheating on a test is probably wrong even if they think it’s right because it’s against the rules, like in school but like if it’s, if there’s like no rule about it and then you still feel good about it, I guess, then it’s okay.
I:So, so there’s some sort of legal rule or, or maybe not necessarily legal but legal as well as school say, rules, or whatever, then those would say what’s right or wrong.
R:Yeah.","Um, probably my parents’ religion.  Um, I don’t know, teachers maybe? Little classroom skits and stuff, I don’t know. Um, if you feel good about it, I guess, like if you don’t feel guilty doing it.  You know.  Like if you, if you can have a clear conscience afterwards, then it’s right. Um, I don’t know.  I usually just kind of know.  Like it’s pretty obviously for most things.  Like you know if you’re gonna go, if somebody offers you drugs, obviously the right thing is to say no, I got that kind of from commercials, but, um,  I don’t know. Yeah. I don’t know. Well I guess if they’re fa—actually, well cheating on a test is probably wrong even if they think it’s right because it’s against the rules, like in school but like if it’s, if there’s like no rule about it and then you still feel good about it, I guess, then it’s okay. Yeah.","The respondent generally makes decisions by consulting trusted friends, believes that moral understanding is influenced by upbringing and peer behavior, and feels that guilt arises from self-imposed standards rather than external pressures, while also acknowledging the role of their parents' religion in shaping their views on right and wrong.","I:How do you decide or know what is good and bad, right and wrong in life?
R:I have no idea.  I just, sort of based on my morals that I grew up with, my parents taught me, like Judaism, what I learn in school, I don’t know, what my friends say that kind of thing.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Generally pretty easy, like to know right from wrong.
I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder over the past 2 years?
R:I think in some areas it’s gotten easier and in some areas it’s gotten harder, like I know in terms of like doing things that are bad, it’s gotten easier, but in terms of like drugs and alcohol and that kind of thing, it’s gotten harder, just cause a lot of my friends are doing it now, and so it’s sort of like, well they’re not dying like they said they would in DARE, they don’t have lung cancer yet, like, harder.
I:Yeah, so it’s partly availability and partly that nothing bad’s happened.
R:Yeah.  Exactly.  I know somebody who smoked pot every day for like 8 months straight and he got an 800 on his SAT’s in math, so it’s like, okay, well if you can sound so stupid in real life and still get an 800 on your math then they’re not really telling us the whole story.  Like that kind of thing.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, how it affects other people and how it affects, or how it could affect myself.  And how it affects people near me, that kind of thing.
I:So what kind of affect or consequences do you have in mind?
R:Um, getting to a judiciary at school.  If you get caught you go through a judiciary at school and they decide your punishment and it goes on your college transcripts and the ultimate consequence is getting kicked out.  Um, having teachers not like me.  Because that’s a big issue too.  You know, I need teacher recommendations and I don’t want to be like the hated person on campus.  And having my parents not trust me, having my friends not like me anymore, having them think that I’m like a horrible person, those are.
I:Are there any actions that are always wrong in themselves, or not?  Or do you think that most things are wrong, all things are wrong because of the consequences that you’re talking about?
R:Um, some things are wrong like stealing something, but a lot of it is influenced by the consequences that you know could arise from it.
I:Why would something like stealing be wrong?  I mean obviously there’s consequences, but is it wrong in itself?
R:Just because it’s not, I don’t know you’re hurting other people, so I guess it’s like a consequence thing.  But you’re stealing from other people, if you’re stealing from a store, then the owners of the store will either have to raise their prices or somehow have to compensate for it.  That’s not fair to them.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?  Where do they come from?  You mentioned earlier family,
R:From my parents a lot, and, Judaism, and I don’t know, I guess the media a lot.  Sort of like, they sort of portray what’s right and wrong, like what a bad person would do and what a good person would do on TV shows.
I:So more like TV shows kind of thing.
R:Yeah.","I have no idea.  I just, sort of based on my morals that I grew up with, my parents taught me, like Judaism, what I learn in school, I don’t know, what my friends say that kind of thing.

R:I don’t know. I guess it goes back to sort of like, do I have the same values as my parents. I think they sort of like gave me a good set of values. It’s sort of like going off whether or not I feel good about what I, like the action, I don’t know. I have a very like, sensitive… like I guess sensitive, like right and wrong; like I feel bad really easily about things. Like for example, I was at a stoplight yesterday or two days ago, and the light turned green, the person in front of me wouldn’t go. I waited like five seconds, I don’t know a long time, so I said “This is really weird” so I honked. And like three seconds later an ambulance drove by and I felt miserable. I still feel bad about it, which is like not… Yeah, exactly, but I couldn’t see the ambulance and I also had my like radio on so I couldn’t hear it, and I mean, it’s really not something that I should feel that bad about, but I still feel so bad that I like honked at this person and there was like an ambulance coming.
I:So you try to make them do something bad unintentionally?
R:Yeah, exactly.
I:Would you say that it’s generally easy or hard for you to know, to decide between right and wrong?
R:I think it’s generally easy for me to decide what’s right and wrong. Even if it’s something that’s like, even if the wrong path is like an easier path, I still know what’s wrong and I feel that you should…
I:And would you say that deciding between right and wrong has gotten easier or harder for you over the past two years?
R:I think it’s gotten easier. I think it’s because I sort of made more decisions in the past three years that I have, I don’t know, it’s just sort if like easier to choose the right path, I guess. I don’t know.
I:But do you think your views or ideas about right and wrong have changed in the past two years?
R:I mean, I guess they have matured so I’ve been more like, I guess, adult perspective, so I like, three years ago I thought drinking was a terrible thing and like, “Oh, my God you’ll die if you do it” kind of thing, but now like I’ve been in college for a year and I don’t really think of it as like a bad thing. So I guess in sort of those things have changed, but like morally, my core values, haven’t changed.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:I think it sort of like how it affects other people and then also how, I don’t know, it’s sort of like a benefits versus loses thing, so like cheating may benefit you but it hurts other people because they don’t have the same advantage as you. So I guess sort of comparing that.
I:So bad consequences for other people?
R:Yeah, or just like unfair advantages, maybe.
I:What about something that wouldn’t affect anybody else, theoretically anyway but might be bad for you as consequences? Would that still be a wrong thing to do or… but it’s enjoyable so…
R:I guess, well if there are bad consequences for you, then probably it’s still a bad choice—like doing drugs, I guess, is good. I don’t know. Like people enjoy it… I suppose they just like people continue to do it but there’s still like bad consequences in the end.
I:Where do your moral views come from? Where do you think you have gotten your moral views from?
R:I think I’ve gotten them from, I guess, my parents, and then also like Judaism is sort of morally enriched as a religion, like a lot of the laws I learned about I guess in Jewish day school, had to do with how to treat others and then probably a lot from my peers too.

R:Well what makes something right is like when you think of the outcome of what that is and if that’s, if that’s something that you want.  Then it’s the right thing to do.
I:Okay, are there um, are there other kinds of things that make something right or wrong?
R:Um, probably like, probably like how society looks on you based on what you’re doing.  Like if you do something and society looks down on you because it’s probably the wrong thing to do.
I:So how do you decide or know what’s, what’s right and wrong or good and bad?
R:Um, usually I just look at what other people have done and see how they’ve ended up and like use that to make my own decision.
I:Okay, can you give me some examples of stuff?  Like that?
R:Um, like if somebody did drugs and like the outcome was that they got caught and they went to jail or if somebody snuck out of the house and then the outcome is like their parents caught them then that’d be the wrong thing to do, but.
I:Okay, um, so let’s see, um, can you think of anything that might be um, wrong to do but that would, that, in which the outcome would still be okay, though?
R:Um, I’m trying to think.    There’s a lot of things like you could do that the outcome would be okay but like still like your conscience would be really bad, I can’t really think of anything specifically.
I:Okay, so what do you think a feeling of conscience comes from?
R:Um, probably just like you feel guilty like if you like stole your, like stole some money out of like your sister’s piggy bank and she never found out but you’d feel really guilty because like maybe she couldn’t like buy something that she was saving up for.
I:Okay,  sorry.  Um, so what do you think feelings of guilt like that come from, in general?
R:Um, they probably come from like you seeing what happened to the person because of what you did to them, and that makes you feel bad.
I:Because you care about the person, or because it’s kind of just bad to do that kind of thing.
R:Probably a little bit of both, like even if it’s somebody that you don’t care about, you still know it’s like a bad thing to do to that person.
I:Um, how, how do you think most people would know that?
R:Um, I think most people would know that because they’ve seen like other people do it and they wouldn’t want it to happen to them.","Well what makes something right is like when you think of the outcome of what that is and if that’s, if that’s something that you want.

I:Okay in general has it been easy or hard for you to decide what to do?
R:Its been pretty easy, like I can usually like tell. If it’s something that you cant tell your parents then it’s usually not right.
I:Okay, so do you think that’s gotten easier or harder for you in the last couple of years?

I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?

Like, how do you know?
R:I’m sure my parents have taught me, and they’ve set a role model, a good model.  Yeah.  And just growing up, I was surrounded by really good people and I’m sure that their example has really worn off on me.
I:Is it easy or hard to figure out?
R:It’s easy.
I:For you.  Okay.  And you attribute that to family influence?
R:Mm-mm (yes).  Family and friends and teachers.  Yeah.
I:Has it gotten harder or easier in the last 2 years?
R:Ah, the decisions have gotten bigger.  Um, how to study for a test, do I have to study for a test, um, that kid’s cheating, should I hit him?
I:
R:Um, actually, there was a problem at work, maybe that was, that might have been before we talked last time, where somebody was stealing a lot of money, a lot of money from our stand and I had to decide what I was going to do and it turned out that the management knew that somebody was stealing and I actually, I didn’t find that out until I turned her in.  And that was a really hard decision because we had worked together for about six months beforehand, but she was stealing about $100 a day and um, then she offered to like start paying me.  I didn’t, I didn’t know that she was stealing until she, I saw her and I was like what are you, I asked her what she was doing and then she offered to give me half, so.
I:M3:And how do you, in that situation, like how do you decide what’s right or wrong to do?  What’s the process you go through?
R:M3:Well, the, I guess I was lucky because I knew right away what the correct thing to do was, that I should turn her in and that was obvious, but the problem was that I didn’t want to do that.  So, it’s not a matter of right and wrong, really, it’s a matter of what’s easy, sometimes.  And just it’s really helped, my parents have always helped me realize that the easy thing, the right thing is rarely the easy thing, and so I’ve always remembered that.
I:And what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Um, its effects, its broader effects on people.
I:And what kinds of effects, especially?
R:If um, if it’s going to hurt anybody or if it’s just going to detract from anybody’s happiness in a substantial manner or somebody is going to be badly influenced by it, then that’s what I would consider.
I:Are there any actions that you would see as wrong in themselves, or not?
R:Um, just inherently wrong, like murder and some crimes, but um, there, I feel like there’s always, as much as I believe in absolute right and wrong, well some absolute right and wrong, I think that there’s always a gray area because, especially as I’ve gotten older, I realize that there is always a background story, there’s always more to somebody’s decision than what’s on the surface.
I:Okay.  Anything that makes something wrong, in itself?  Is there a particular thing that makes it wrong?
R:Um, intentionally doing something to hurt somebody else, that has, that will not benefit you and you’re just doing, malicious intent.  That is wrong.
I:Okay, uh-huh.  And where would you say you’ve gotten your moral views?  Like, where do they come from?

R:I think about things really carefully. I really consider all my options really carefully and hopefully right and wrong would be kind of instinctual, and instinctive. I mean things of—but if its ambiguous I would probably talk to my parents.
I:So in general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:Pretty easy. I mean, of course, that good thing that would come about from having had—I think the really difficult to determine problem. I never had to decide whether or not to kill somebody, I guess. So it might be relatively easy decision making period but it is fine.
I:And then, do you see that getting easier or harder over the next few years?
R:Perhaps easier but, like I said I had never had any real big problems, I guess, had to determine the right course.
I:What do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:If it affects some other people. If you make a decision that is going to negatively affect others then it’s probably wrong.
I:So what are some examples of things you’ve seen recently?
R:Just to continue with this example, if I wanted to…I don’t know, not to work for the next two years, if I decide to take the next two years off, and investigate sleep patterns and then I would probably, I’d be relying on my parents, I’d be relying on my fiancé for finances or support and it would be the wrong decision. I mean, of course, it would be the wrong decision for me too because I’d be dumb and lazy but, definitely the wrong choice.
I:So something is wrong if it hurts other people.
R:Yeah.
I:And from where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Probably my parents provided the framework and then I have my experience and my friends kind of filled in the edges, just thinking about it.","I think about things really carefully.

Probably easier, cuz I just know more, and I’m not put in umm, you know when you’re younger, you’re put in a lot of different situations that you don’t know how to handle yet.  As you get older, you know those situations when they come about and you know how to handle them better.  I guess right or wrong isn’t like a fact, I think it’s just beliefs.

R:I don’t know.  I mean you just you ootta guess and think about the way that it will make others feel and the way it’s gonna effect others and you think about the things that you learned when you were in kindergarten.  Those were probably good guidelines.
I:In general, is it easy or hard for you to decide between right and wrong?
R:I don’t know it’s just kind of hard sometimes because I don’t really believe in very strict like morality. I think there’s so many greys and things are not black and white.  So you’ve gotta weigh your options and really think about it and the context of time and the context of who and where and they why and like, it can get really tricky.

I:so how it affects other people

I:So each situation has its own what’s right and wrong with it.
R:Yeah, definitely.
I:Does it differ for different people?
R:maybe.  Probably for different people in different situations.  Like it’s like, this dude had a sick wife and she was dying and can’t afford the medicine and can’t just look at everything that’s black and white.
I:From where have you acquired your moral views?
R:Oh I don’t know.  Probably TV or something. Teachers, mom, dad, friends, family, anyone who would yell at me on the streets.
I:Do you think that your views of right and wrong have changed over the past three years?
R:I mean I guess, maybe something’s.
I:Can you think of main examples?

I:Has deciding between right and wrong gotten easier or harder in the past two years?
R:Easier.
I:Why?
R:I’ve had to make more choices between right and wrong and so as I keep making the right ones and maybe one or two wrong ones it just gets easier and easier to keep doing.
I:Have your views changed about what’s right and wrong in the past few years?
R:No.
I:So what do you think it is that makes something right or wrong?
R:Is it really stupid or not?  Could it hurt someone else or that person?  And will it effect them later on in life?

R:I think it’s just passed along and with basic perception of people we can get most of the time what’s right and wrong.
I:So it’s something that humans just learn on their own?
R:Umhmm.  For a basic age you learned that sharing was good, not to take from other people and as we keep growing up we learn through experience the difference between right and wrong.
